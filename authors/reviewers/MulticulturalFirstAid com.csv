24,AFBPJV3CDVZAW36WZD2SJHSYXKUA,"April 30, 2020",An indoctrination into Protestantism. Makes ONE statement - you get into Heaven by asking for mercy.,"This is NOT about Jesus being a rebel. This is NOT about being free from religion. I started reading the 'book' (if you can call it that), and it was just a lot of personal stories strung together awkwardly, with the intention of leading the reader to ONE sole conclusion: There is ONLY ONE way to get to Heaven, and it is to be a Christian and to ask for mercy. But there's a BIG flaw - the author does a lousy job of pretending to be aware of other religions than Protestantism. In an attempt to prop up his own beliefs, he proudly bashes a woman's beliefs in a chapter titled, ""ALL RELIGIONS ARE NOT THE SAME"".

Wait a second here! Didn't you say this book is about ""Breaking Free from Religion to find God""???
What the hypocritical ___?!

He talks about Professors shaming Christians, then he goes on to shame her by LITERALLY bashing Hindu, Buddhism, Atheism (YES even though the book is about BREAKING FREE OF RELIGION). And he goes further to state, ""I am a Protestant and not a Catholic because of what the Bible teaches"".

Clearly, this isn't a book about Jesus at all. It isn't even a book about being a better person and walking the path of Jesus. It's about ONE MESSAGE which is, if you want to get to Heaven, forget doing good deeds and being a good person, because nobody is perfect and you cannot earn your way in. You must ask for mercy. For all of the good you do, even if almost a saint, you can never be holy - you can never be perfect, and that can only account for 1% of what you need to get into Heaven. The other 99% is asking for mercy. He does his best throughout to HAMMER this home!

He states, ""Good people go to Heaven, but there has just never been a good person"". So there you have it - his message is not about Jesus being a rebel and walking in His path - his message is, all religion is wrong except for Protestantism, and the ONLY way you can get to Heaven is by 'asking for mercy'.

Question for the author: WHY do you think Jesus provided us with an example of how to live, if it has no bearing on judgement?

Also, I'd like to point out that your statement, ""...the way a good Muslim reacts toward a Christian... saying we believe in the same divine Being..."" - YES Muslims do believe in the same divine being. AND they have more references to Jesus as 'the Christ' and Messiah (but not the son of God), in the Qu'ran than there are in the Bible. And it says The Christ will return at the end of time for the final judgement. Furthermore, the Catholic Church has an official stand, ""The plan of salvation also includes those who acknowledge the Creator, in the first place amongst whom are the Muslims"".

All in all, this 'book', is strung-together personal stories that attempt to get across a single message, the ONLY way to Heaven is by asking for mercy. Nothing you do in life, aside from asking for mercy, will get you into Heaven. All religions are wrong, except for Protestantism.

Sadly, I had expected a book that discussed Jesus' examples of standing up for what is right, in the face of opposition. This is how I live my life - making a stand for the weak and innocent, and always suffering the consequences of doing so. I hoped to find strength from Jesus' examples. Sadly, this book is not about that. It's really about nothing other than propping up the author's ego. He believes his way is the right way and the only way, and reading this book feels like getting hit over the head repeatedly by it. One final note, there's no flow to the book. The author's attempt to weave a story fails on all levels. His statements are wrong (and this causes the reader to say, HUH?!), his beliefs are tainted by ego, and he his self-doubt is shown throughout by his need to hammer home his principles.

You CANNOT cue or listen to one channel without listening to BOTH channels at the same time. So this mixer becomes USELESS as a USB mixer, because you MUST use 2x channels on your mixer to separate the signal you send to the headphones. That means NOT using the USB connection at all for mixing, but instead using sound out from your computer.

To be able to cue a left or right channel, all Behringer needed to do was to add BALANCE to the headphones so you could listen to the left or right channel. But they were too cheap to add a simple switch to make it possible.

It's likely pretty easy to modify it yourself, but why bother when there are other mixers that do it for you.

Also, while Behringer does make a feedback eliminator, this mixer does NOT handle feedback elimination. It simply has an LED in the EQ levels, and if the signal is stronger, you see the red LED glow. If you wanted to adjust your EQ on the mixer to deal with the problem, you would have to affect MANY frequencies at the same time. And if you wanted to connect an external EQ, say 24-32-64 channel for example, then the EQ would be AFTER the mixer, in which case the LEDs would not be affected.

The problem is that first, it is quite weak and often doesn't find the bluetooth device a foot away. The other problem is that it does NOT automatically reconnect to my powered bluetooth speaker. I have to REMOVE the speaker from the list of detected devices, then search again and connect.

I use the speaker with my smartphone, and what my smartphone does that this does not is:
1. Allows me to rename the connection from A33 to TDK Speakers
2. Automatically connects when I turn on bluetooth on my smartphone
3. Easily detect and use bluetooth devices without having to REMOVE the device, then search for it again and connect again.

Maybe all bluetooth adapters for Windows 8 are this lame... I don't know as this is the only one I have. But compared to the one built into my smartphone, I am very unimpressed with this one.

One model uses the ceramic part that has a yellow plastic holder, but another model of the 304 uses the same as the 305. Fluval website does not show the model that uses the same parts as the 305.

How to tell the difference:
If your Fluval 304 uses the straight impeller blades, then you need THIS part to work with the ceramic shaft.

If your Fluval 3-4 uses the curved impeller blades, then you need the CLEAR cover and NOT this one.

Mine uses the straight impeller blades, and this is the correct cover (smoke color).

Easy to connect with Bluetooth, and also works as a speaker phone with your smart phone. Also has Aux. input.

Rechargeable lithium battery that lasts 6 hours or so, and also has a USB output for charging your cell phone, etc. whenever it is plugged in.
