0,R18BRICANBG6BQ," Purchased for wife, who wants to add some RGB to her desk setup.
Similar in size and shape as other gaming mice. A contoured design/grip fits comfortably in hand, although feels very light. This could be a pro/con depending on personal preference.

The mouse glides well over both cloth pads as well as hard surface with accurate tracking/movements.
The left/right buttons are responsive and while the scroll wheel does have a loose feeling, it does work as expected.
The DPI button with variable DPI settings can be tailored to fit your use/need and can prove to be very useful in specific games and/or play style.

The mouse is equipt with a braided cable, which from my personal experience tends to be more durable to wear and much less prone to tangles, compared to rubber/plastic coated cables.

Although there is no option to set any 1 specific solid/steady color, the lighting does work well as it cycles through a rainbow of color in a breathing effect. Very cool, especially in dim to dark atmosphere. The lighting can be turned off by pressing the Forward/Back buttons + DPI button.

No additional drivers/software required, just Plug&Play!

Overall, a decent quality mouse which has exceeded my expectations, especially at this price point.

Recommend to anyone looking for a budget friendly mouse with an added style of RGB lighting. ★★★★☆",DownEastCaper,2020-09-15 05:01:11.257494,2020-09-15 05:01:11.330587,"HAVIT HV-MS672 Ergonomic Wired Mouse, 2400 DPI, 7 Soothing LED Colors, 6 Buttons [ 2016 Model ]"
1,R3MQOA9DI6PMSN,"The mouse arrived fine, but when I plugged it in the LED's inside the mouse were all screwed up. For some reason, only a few of the colors show up as solid colors, and the others show up as missmatched ones. For example, purple and cyan never show up as their own colors because the top half ends up being purple while the bottom half is red, and for cyan, the top is cyan while the bottom is the bright green color. The only colors that show up solid are green, royal blue and red. I haven't even seen the yellow or orange colors yet. Also, there's a strange little part that pokes out at your palm from the middle below the DPI button, but I don't really mind it. I see how for some users, it could be annoying. I've also noticed that the scroll wheel is a tad loose, and I'm worried that it'll come off or break in the future.

But, with that being said, this mouse is awesome in functionality. The sensor is responsive, and I've experienced no input lag at all while playing games. I do find the forward/back buttons to be a little close to the thumb, but I'm not pressing them accidentally as of yet. I would have gave this mouse a solid 5 star rating if the LED's worked properly.

UPDATE: I contacted customer service and they were able to send me a new mouse for free for all the trouble. I am 100% satisfied with the mouse and the great customer service that I received from Havit. Thank you!",wiccawitch4,2020-09-15 05:01:11.335331,2020-09-15 05:01:11.385229,"HAVIT HV-MS672 Ergonomic Wired Mouse, 2400 DPI, 7 Soothing LED Colors, 6 Buttons [ 2016 Model ]"
2,R1GGBLH5A0SASQ,"I bought this mouse to replace my $100 Razer Naga. The Razer kept lagging out (razer software issue) and I replaced it with a 8 dollar mouse, which is simple consistent, and I'm honestly surprised at the usb cord quality, it's braided and the connector end has anti-break properties., The DPI is good enough for 99.99% of people and applications, I've played everything from over watch to League to SC2 to XCOM 2 with this mouse and it was a good go, Didn't notice performace issues. It has a slightly heavier click than the Naga, but for shooters I actually prefer it because I get better feedback over my clicks. It's worse if you're an insane MOBA or RTS clicker but again, I didn't even notice it while gaming. I also like how you don't have to install any more software - it's straight plug and play.",Amazon Customer,2020-09-15 05:01:11.390169,2020-09-15 05:01:11.438645,"HAVIT HV-MS672 Ergonomic Wired Mouse, 2400 DPI, 7 Soothing LED Colors, 6 Buttons [ 2016 Model ]"

I got this to replace a cheapo Microsoft mouse and this kicks the hell out of it! It works great, has a great light show, has features my plain Microsoft mouse didn't have and was cheaper.

4,RYSA70ONDAWRZ,"I bought this mouse primarily for PC fortnite gaming and it has done me very well. Whit I like about this mouse is that for the price it is light, durable (been is my school backpack everyday for the past 2 months) and has a good matte finish. Th RGB lighting is good and it has a great selection of sensitivities. The one thing that kind of bothers me is that the buttons on the side are a little hard to press, they are thinner than they look. Other than that this little beast is great. I have been using it as a mouse (because I can't stand school chromebook trackpads) and it is great.

5,R27RU9EEA569KA,"I bought this mouse about a year ago (slightly less). It worked well for about half a year, and then the right-mouse button started having problems where it would randomly refuse to register a click unless I smashed it. At this point, it would have been a 3-star product because - lets face it - it's super cheap. However, I contacted Havit directly and they immediately sent me a new mouse (it was still under warranty) which arrived within the week. I now push this up to 4 stars because of their excellent customer service.

Thanks Havit. I appreciate it!

Since the mouse is now $9.99, I think it's a good deal, especially since it come with a 1-year warranty.",Prefers to Stay Anon,2020-09-15 05:01:11.555941,2020-09-15 05:01:11.635275,"HAVIT HV-MS672 Ergonomic Wired Mouse, 2400 DPI, 7 Soothing LED Colors, 6 Buttons [ 2016 Model ]"
6,R3NLOFYDMNT8MT,Just an amazing mouse! It looks gorgeous with all these colour schemes. You can change how quickly the lights blink by pressing the button behind the mouse wheel. Changes automatically between several different beautiful colours. I have medium-sized hands with long guitarist fingers: the mouse fits my palm perfectly and feels very ergonomic. Buttons are big and click well. Mouse wheel resistance is ideal for optimal web page scrolling and gaming.

8,RQQA4LPIRBNQ1,"I have another Havit Gaming mouse with driver + extra buttons for 4 years that I am very happy with and decided to go with this brand again. This is a decent mouse. I wish there is driver for it to allow users to turn off the LED light, or set it to one specific colour. This mouse is on the large side for me (F with small hands), I will have to shift my hand upwards to press the forward/back buttons. I am gifting it to my father for office use, so it shouldn't be too much of a problem. Sensitivity is not perfect on every surface, if I turn up the DPI, the mouse speed is a little too fast and require changes in WIndows setting.

10,R3F7TCOG0AGIP4,"I only purchased this mouse because it had the best reviews and was the cheapest...I guess some things are too good to be true. I received the mouse just 2 days ago and the mouse already kept glitching at random times. I'd have to disconnect it and reconnect it every time, so that it would stop glitching for 1 minute. It's a horrible experience for me because I'm in-game while the mouse starts losing it's sensory. I lost a game or two because of this issue already. Thought this was going to be my perfect gaming mouse, but it's more like my way to losing-the-game mouse.

- Braided USB cable and reinforced port

The mouse is made for larger hands and has adjustable dpi settings (toggle button below mouse wheel). There are functioning front/back buttons on the side. The 'front' button is a bit awkward to reach, but it's not enough to complain about, just a consideration. Lighting is cool and the BEST part is that the mouse wheel has subtle detents when you scroll. It took me a while to find out how to describe the mouse wheel-bumpy-feel action.

15,RHQWMQ575R98U,"In terms of material... it feels just like any other typical mouse... unless you get those high-end memory cushioned layer mouse and etc.
It feels very sturdy and works as intended. I was hoping it had a double click button as I game a lot and that button is super useful, however, it's not a fault in the product. Just a feature I hoped it had.
The LEDs are cool... my kids loves it, I don't care for it much but for the price, I would definitely buy this again if I ever need a new mouse

Update: Got this on Sept 4th, and now after a few months... the scrolling wheel is faulty. It shouldn't be ""wear and tear"" already this soon. When scrolling, it now flickers the scroll so when u try to scroll down, it goes down and immediately back up. Sometimes it even goes up twice with every scroll down on the wheel. At first, I thought maybe I had to unplug it and plug it back in due to a one time glitch or hardware malfunction but that didn't fix it at all. Now I can do everything except using the mouse scrolling wheel... which is quite important on a mouse. Such a shame because it's a great mouse aside from this current issue",Kevin,2020-09-15 05:01:19.148055,2020-09-15 05:01:19.668664,"HAVIT HV-MS672 Ergonomic Wired Mouse, 2400 DPI, 7 Soothing LED Colors, 6 Buttons [ 2016 Model ]"

30,R2ELIBXE9IIEF3,"The scrolling wheel and clicking is responsive (though, the scrolling has a ""medium-ish: resistance - maybe a bit loose for me). The mouse is fairly light and glides relatively smoothly. The braid cord seems to be durable as well. It is a bigger mouse than what I am used to (compare it to a Logitceh M325 in the pictures) so the thumb buttons are a bit awkward/uncomfortable to press for my fairly small hands. The colours change and cannot be set to one specific colour, so keep that in mind.

Overall, I'm pretty happy with this purchase. This mouse may need some getting used to depending on where you're coming from.

UPDATE: After about 20+ hours of use, I'd say this mouse helped me with my wrist problems. After getting used to it, it's much more comfortable (I guess it's a good thing I switched from a tiny mouse).

The mouse is light weight, ergonomic, isn't overly loud when clicking, has pretty good dpi for the price range, cycles colours and looks cool. The build quality doesn't feel overly robust but other than the scroll wheel it stood the tests of daily rigorous use for awhile. After using the mouse daily (about eight hours a day) for about a year the scroll wheel failed. Scrolling the mouse wheel such as for viewing text results in the mouse having difficulty detecting if you are scrolling up or down, which is annoying to say the least. I'd say it is still a pretty solid bet for the price point. The dpi is sufficient enough that it can be used for gaming and professional work. Just realize that the scroll wheel may eventually fail and the mouse will require replacement. For what it is worth, this mouse has outlasted several much more expensive mice from Logitech over the same period.",Daryl Vander Veen,2020-09-15 05:01:30.087733,2020-09-15 05:01:30.138988,"HAVIT HV-MS672 Ergonomic Wired Mouse, 2400 DPI, 7 Soothing LED Colors, 6 Buttons [ 2016 Model ]"

35,R18HDXB57U1HWS,"I have larger-than-average hands and use a ""fingertip"" grip. The feel in hand is good, better than some more expensive non-gaming mice. However, it's another story when it comes to clicking buttons. They are harder to press than the logitech mouse it replaced, causing some measure of pain in my arm when using it for long gaming sessions. I find that I try to relax my hand by using a ""palm grip"", but the mouse is not tall enough to provide enough support for my hand.

Pros:
-inexpensive, I just needed something to spam buttons
-adjustable DPI

Cons:
-does not register my inputs 3 out of 10 times (I physically press the left mouse button, but there is no response on the computer), perhaps a lemon?
-left and right buttons are a bit harder to press than my logitech mice, to the point where I can't game for long stretches without having some discomfort in my wrist and arm",cptbooya,2020-09-15 05:01:30.199823,2020-09-15 05:01:30.248230,"HAVIT HV-MS672 Ergonomic Wired Mouse, 2400 DPI, 7 Soothing LED Colors, 6 Buttons [ 2016 Model ]"
36,R2RVR2O9XAZ06M,"I didn't really find it that comfortable fitting in my hand, but MUCH more worse is that it cannot hold down a click at all.

I don't think I'm very picky, and this mouse was unplayable with, I tried to hold on for about a week but get something better if you're doing anything where you have to hold your clicks.

ALMOST A 4-YEAR UPDATE: From this you have to trust me. Overall the mouse is a good deal. For my 3rd year of having it my mouse has some issues with the scrolling and it tends to scroll the opposite.

38,R5ID4HXJT8S1O,"The housing has a pointy bit that digs straight up into your hand. Between that and the very heavy trigger pulls on the left/right click buttons, it was painful to use for more than about 10 minutes.

That being said, the tracking on this mouse is unreasonably good for ten bucks, so is the quality of the cord.",Janice Wadsworth,2020-09-15 05:01:30.372671,2020-09-15 05:01:30.422805,"HAVIT HV-MS672 Ergonomic Wired Mouse, 2400 DPI, 7 Soothing LED Colors, 6 Buttons [ 2016 Model ]"

40,R2ELIBXE9IIEF3,"The scrolling wheel and clicking is responsive (though, the scrolling has a ""medium-ish: resistance - maybe a bit loose for me). The mouse is fairly light and glides relatively smoothly. The braid cord seems to be durable as well. It is a bigger mouse than what I am used to (compare it to a Logitceh M325 in the pictures) so the thumb buttons are a bit awkward/uncomfortable to press for my fairly small hands. The colours change and cannot be set to one specific colour, so keep that in mind.

Overall, I'm pretty happy with this purchase. This mouse may need some getting used to depending on where you're coming from.

UPDATE: After about 20+ hours of use, I'd say this mouse helped me with my wrist problems. After getting used to it, it's much more comfortable (I guess it's a good thing I switched from a tiny mouse).

41,R19XV8NLVDSAZA,"This mouse is a great mouse to buy. For the price that I bought it for (12.99 + tax) it is by far the best mouse in the market. With the 6-button layout, users can easily bind keys to the mouse to make a game or just about anything better. Also, thanks to the ergonomic grip style used for the mouse, holding the mouse feels awesome and you have ease of access to the extra buttons. The mouse feels great and performs great.
