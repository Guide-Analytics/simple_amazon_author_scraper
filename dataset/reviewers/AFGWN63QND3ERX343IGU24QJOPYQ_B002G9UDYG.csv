Great case for $129.99 CAD, mine had a dent in the front panel and had to wait 2 weeks.

----------------------------------------------------------

This case is great, great quality and cable management, have nothing bad to say about it, the tempered glass panel can be a little finicky because the screws and threads are so short.

The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because mine came with a nice dent in the top of the front panel, I am aware I probably could have sent it back and had it replaced, but when I ordered it originally the case said in stock with prime delivery, then they emailed me and said that it was on back order, waited 2 weeks and it finally showed up and I did not feel like waiting to build my computer for another 2 weeks.",yes,0,2.0,https://www.amazon.ca/NZXT-Desktop-Computer-CA-H700B-B1-Black/dp/B07C3SKSFK/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-17 21:23:32.199639,2020-09-17 21:23:41.478769,X.Farrell,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
