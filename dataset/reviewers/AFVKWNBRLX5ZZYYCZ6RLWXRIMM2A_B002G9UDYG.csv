0,AFVKWNBRLX5ZZYYCZ6RLWXRIMM2A,"June 24, 2020",Leaks!,"Leaks slightly around where the cap screws into the bottle. It leaked when it was in my backpack and broke my laptop. Had to get a part replaced because of it. I also noticed that it leaks when it is very full, again where the cap screws on.
The bottle keeps the water cold but not for very long. Overall, cute and easy to use but I will buy a more secure one for bringing around...",yes,0,3.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Tervis-1232564-Peanuts-Tumbler-Emblem/dp/B01M02KN4O/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 15:13:18.547950,2020-09-18 15:13:25.809449,Ally,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
1,AFVKWNBRLX5ZZYYCZ6RLWXRIMM2A,"April 9, 2020",Great value and amazing customer service!,"Just wanted to say, amazing customer service! I had one single hoop that broke after a couple months. I emailed the customer service and they responded really quickly with either a refund or a new pack! Considering there are 24 pairs and only 1 hoop broke, that customer service is amazing. Definitely will check out other items in their store.
As for the product itself, I really like the value for what you pay for. It is a little bit thicker and a little bit heavier than I expected but it also feels better made than some hoops I ordered off AliExpress. Wish they would do a pack with just the smaller half because I don't ever use the big hoops!",yes,2,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Finrezio-24Pairs-Earrings-Earring-Fashion/dp/B07PY3529T/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 15:13:32.902942,2020-09-18 15:13:40.211870,Ally,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
2,AFVKWNBRLX5ZZYYCZ6RLWXRIMM2A,"February 8, 2020",Similar to lulu,"These are NOT like Lululemon aligns!! I got them because I wanted a dupe for the aligns but these are not the same at all Got a size small and I wear size 4 in Lululemons. These feel like the lulu wunder unders with luxtreme** (not the luon ones). They are that thinner slippery cool feeling pants, not buttery feeling (align) or cottony feeling (luon). These ones are definitely not as compressed as the lulus so I could've went with the XS instead but I like that they arent suffocating as the size 4 lulus luxtreme ones are a little bit tight. Very high waisted like the lulus with thin and flat waistband. I'm not sure what the other review is talking about.
These hit me a bit above my ankles cuz I'm short (5'3). Only thing I wish was the bottom of the pants to be tighter. My ankles are skinny so they flare out just the slightest bit. Overall, for $30 these are great. They are thicker than the Aerie 7/8 ones and are great to wear casually or at home when I don't want to ruin my lulus (from excess lint, pilling etc).",yes,10,4.0,https://www.amazon.ca/CRZ-YOGA-Feeling-Workout-Leggings-25/dp/B07N2WSJJ3/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 15:13:48.307168,2020-09-18 15:13:54.592971,Ally,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
3,AFVKWNBRLX5ZZYYCZ6RLWXRIMM2A,"January 9, 2020",Handy and works well!,"Works well. Really useful to keep in the car for a road trip with a car plug for our friends that have different types of phone. This is also good to keep in the house for different guests. The cord is nylon and braided which I prefer as rubber ones tend to break faster. However, I haven't used it much so I cannot comment on the durability.",yes,0,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Digital-HuTeck-Charging-Compatible-Micro-USB/dp/B07Z6RDF1Q/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 15:14:01.685329,2020-09-18 15:14:07.941061,Ally,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
4,AFVKWNBRLX5ZZYYCZ6RLWXRIMM2A,"December 16, 2019",It's just okay.,"It's a basic humidifier. I use it in my small double bed bedroom. The water runs out quite quickly so don't listen to the people that say you can use this for larger spaces. For my small room I set it to the first 1/3 of the dial, and it can run for 2 nights ish (however i only turn it on after I get home ~after 4pm). The insides get orange and start to stain from the water. It gets dirty quite quickly as well. I try to clean it with a toothbrush but it's quite difficult (as it stains). So for $40 it's not bad.",yes,0,4.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Humidifiers-TaoTronics-Ultrasonic-Humidifier-Operation/dp/B01CCJN328/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 15:14:16.036301,2020-09-18 15:14:22.318647,Ally,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
