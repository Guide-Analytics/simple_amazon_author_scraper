0,AGCG5GX5NFPZ3L233RDTNVQA5YBA,"July 6, 2020",Inexpensive way to look cool,"Great bang for the buck. They are on the large side so if you have a smaller head/face they may look huge on you. I'm a fan of oversized shades so these do the trick. I always wear Carrera sunglasses. These are not that quality but for $26, you can't go wrong",yes,0,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Oversized-Aviator-Sunglasses-Vintage-Gradient/dp/B0752F5QQY/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 21:06:38.523351,2020-09-18 21:06:47.757037,john currie,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
1,AGCG5GX5NFPZ3L233RDTNVQA5YBA,"April 13, 2020",Great bang for the buck,"Very happy with these boots. Was debating whether to purchase a pair of Under Armour at almost 3 times the price. Been wearing them for a week now and have no complaints.

I wear a custom orthotic so the insole wasn't a concern for me. That being said you will definitely need to purchase a gel insole. The insole that comes with the boot are very thin. Almost no support whatsoever. Boots fit a bit big. I would recommend a half size smaller than your regular size. I work in a warehouse setting. So can't say whether these boots would hold up on a construction site. They are lighter than your average work boot.

All in all very happy with my purchase.",yes,One,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/NORTIV-Industrial-Anti-Slip-Military-Trooper-Steel/dp/B07V8H6T7T/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 21:06:57.845908,2020-09-18 21:07:05.125087,john currie,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG

5,AGCG5GX5NFPZ3L233RDTNVQA5YBA,"December 2, 2019",Great vacuum for the money,Bought this on Black Friday on sale. Great bang for the buck. Have never used a Dyson but can't imagine its 3 to 4 times better than this vacuum. Based on the price difference. Ideal for any pet owner.
