0,AGHGPVHAOJBG6JEWG7III3WEWQOQ,"April 27, 2020",Quality product. Very simple - select ear buds from bluetooth list and you are set.,These are quality ear buds with rich sound and a nice storage/charging case. I am a Luddite and the set up takes 10 seconds. Just select from list of bluetooth devices and you are set. You do have to disconnect before switching to another device.

3,AGHGPVHAOJBG6JEWG7III3WEWQOQ,"December 4, 2019",Poor reception,"These would be a great bargain if they worked. They don't. We had the basic indoor RCA flat panel that worked well enough. It picked up 12 channels in our location - sometimes more.

4,AGHGPVHAOJBG6JEWG7III3WEWQOQ,"December 8, 2018",Just okay,"Based on prior reviews I was expecting better quality and weight. They are just okay.

5,AGHGPVHAOJBG6JEWG7III3WEWQOQ,"December 8, 2018",Very pleased,"We bought four ""bed in a box"" mattresses for a small summer home in Newfoundland. We could not fit regular box spring type mattresses up the stairs. Free shipping to the very rural door was a big bonus. We are pleased with them all but these two are the most comfortable (medium firm), and had the best quality cover. In my experience, they are every bit as good quality and comfortable as mattresses from major brand names costing three times as much. No off-gassing issues.

8,AGHGPVHAOJBG6JEWG7III3WEWQOQ,"December 8, 2018",Fantastic quality for the price,"These are fantastic quality lenses for the price. A dramatic improvement over what I had. Wide field of view.

9,AGHGPVHAOJBG6JEWG7III3WEWQOQ,"December 8, 2018",Smaller than it appears in the photos. Wrong mount.,This unit is much smaller and lighter than I was expecting. The mounting bracket makes it unsuitable for use in a normal sized shower stall as it does not permit enough adjustment to direct the spray down rather that horizontally. The most downward adjustment still has the water spraying directly at the shower door. I tried it in three shower stalls and had to remove it each time due to the adjustment problem.

10,AGHGPVHAOJBG6JEWG7III3WEWQOQ,"December 8, 2018",Smaller and heavier than you may think,"I bought these for children to play dress-up. They use them, but it is a delicate exercise to keep them on their head. It is very heavy and smaller in circumference than you may be thinking. This one sits on top of the head, not around it like a hat. It requires bobby pins to hold it on and it falls off easily. i think it is intended for fancy hairdos more suitable for a bride at a wedding. Even then, it is so heavy, that it would come flying off with any sudden movement. Decent quality for the price. They seem unnecessarily chunky and heavy.

14,AGHGPVHAOJBG6JEWG7III3WEWQOQ,"December 8, 2018","compact, plug and play","This is the second bluetooth transmitter I got for a second TV. This one was much more compact and genuinely was plug and play. It paired right away without having to read directions. There is not perceptible delay in the audio. It is probably just a setting on the TV and the fact that I am using the earphone jack, but plugging this one in causes the TV speakers to mute. It has an annoying flashing light that activates when the tv and headphones are turned off. That is annoying when using it in a dark bedroom and you want to sleep.

We first steam the milk directly into the cup, then add two shots of espresso directly into the same cup. I get a bit of joy every time watching the physics of two unlike fluids mixing and settling. We have had them for a couple of months and put them in the dishwasher without issue. Just be careful not to place other items that can move in contact with them. The only drawback is that I usually gauge the milk temperature but feeling the warmth coming through the cup.
