3,AGLDEZEF4MV6CWG66KNSYBNIY3LA,"February 21, 2020","I wouldn't recommend the case, but I still use it","It's a durable case in protecting your phone and I really like the piece to use as a stand for watching YouTube or Netflix. The only downfall is the coating on the case scratches off easily. I've just scratched it all off, so that it's one even colour. It's more of a lighter pink. I'm not sure why they bother with the top coating as it doesn't stay on.",yes,0,3.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Spigen-Extreme-Protection-Technology-Designed/dp/B074CN6S15/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-19 01:16:44.269131,2020-09-19 01:16:50.534323,Amazon Customer,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG

5,AGLDEZEF4MV6CWG66KNSYBNIY3LA,"February 21, 2020",Works well,"I use this on little travel adventures when I can't bring the letterbox in. Haven't tried while flying yet. I bring a ziplock bag of litter with me to fill when needed for the box. It's somewhat easy to empty out, except the sides start collapsing on you as you do, so it takes finesse. Cleans easy enough. I do like that it folds up after.",yes,0,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Texsens-Innovative-Traveler-Backpack-Switchable/dp/B074SJ2NCT/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-19 01:17:13.996158,2020-09-19 01:17:21.271711,Amazon Customer,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG

10,AGLDEZEF4MV6CWG66KNSYBNIY3LA,"January 6, 2018",Unpredictable seeds,"I've changed my review since growing the AeroGarden herbs for a couple of months now. My parsley grew wonderfully, the oregano has only produced one stem and there have been only four mature leaves on it. They brown and die typically, but I'm still hoping he'll pull through. The basil was wonderful, but the seeds have been mixed. I ordered Italian herbs and one of the basil stems is a Thai basil.",yes,3,3.0,https://www.amazon.ca/AeroGarden-Italian-Herb-Seed-9-Pod/dp/B01614SYXI/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-19 01:18:39.762592,2020-09-19 01:18:46.059406,Amazon Customer,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
