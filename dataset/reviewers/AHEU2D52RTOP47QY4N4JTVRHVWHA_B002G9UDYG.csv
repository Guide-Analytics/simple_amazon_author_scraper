0,AHEU2D52RTOP47QY4N4JTVRHVWHA,"February 17, 2019",Great easy way to mount your phone.,"Easy install and strong magnets. Comes with duplicates of everything so you get 2 mounts and 4 magnetic plates.

The magnetic force is really strong. I stuck the magnet on my case and it does not move during bumpy rides. Placing it inbetween the case and phone does work for slimmer cases, but I am using the spigen rugged case and it is too thick and the magnet needs to be stuck on the outside of the case",yes,0,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Spigen-Magnetic-Holder-iPhone-Galaxy/dp/B01C6HSDG2/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 16:44:00.685945,2020-09-18 16:44:08.994001,Amazon Customer,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
1,AHEU2D52RTOP47QY4N4JTVRHVWHA,"February 17, 2019",Loyal Spigen customer!,"I've had this type of case for my lg g6 and now pixel 2 xl and it is what I expected out of Spigen.

Provides great protection for your phone with dual layers and a raised lip to protect the screen. It does add a little bulk, but it is the cost of extra protection/peace of mind. Also looks very sleek

Spigen is a real force in the cellphone accessory market. I also have their magnetic car mount which I paired with this case. NOTE: this case is thick so putting the magnet inside the case does not provide the enough sticking force to the mount. I stuck the magnet right on the outside of the case and it really sticks.",yes,0,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Spigen-Kickstand-Cushion-Technology-Protection/dp/B07477LL8Q/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 16:44:18.086404,2020-09-18 16:44:24.371811,Amazon Customer,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
2,AHEU2D52RTOP47QY4N4JTVRHVWHA,"February 17, 2019",Great alternative to name brand shift stops,"Overall the install was fairly easy (this was my first mod that I've ever installed, so pretty easy if you're a handy guy). It took about 45 minutes. There are tons of tutorials on YouTube which is where I learned.

I'm going to say this product makes a noticeable different when shifting 1st and 2nd. It doesn't remove all the notchyness, but it does make it A LOT smoother

I would recommend this product. I've never tried a Perrin shift stop, but why buy something that cost 50% more for a product that works just as well.

Note: installed on my 2018 Subaru WRX base",yes,One,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/DEF-Performance-Shifter-Removal-Anodized-Forester/dp/B0758WD3DD/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 16:44:32.457152,2020-09-18 16:44:41.732725,Amazon Customer,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
3,AHEU2D52RTOP47QY4N4JTVRHVWHA,"January 20, 2019","Worked perfectly, until...","I write this review almost half a year later to say that the SSD randomly died. Explored most options until confirming that this is true because chkdsk.exe would crash not completing the scan. Reformatting/Resetting the SSD would also not crash the PC.

Now this may just be a singular event, but until this point, this SSD was working perfectly. Maybe its just bad luck.",yes,0,3.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Kingston-Digital-480GB-SA400S37-480G/dp/B01N0TQPQB/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 16:44:49.823526,2020-09-18 16:44:59.109439,Amazon Customer,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG

5,AHEU2D52RTOP47QY4N4JTVRHVWHA,"December 28, 2017","Loved the ""fat"" flipped part of the beanie","Loved the ""fat"" flipped part of the beanie. It appears to be well made, with a medium-weight fabric that is also very stretchy. It's what I expected it to be. Has somewhat of a street wear look to it, but I can also see this worn as a normal toque. Will buy another in black and maybe some other colour.",yes,0,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Carhartt-Acrylic-Watch-Black-Size/dp/B002G9UDYG/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 16:45:24.565063,2020-09-18 16:45:32.847496,Amazon Customer,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
