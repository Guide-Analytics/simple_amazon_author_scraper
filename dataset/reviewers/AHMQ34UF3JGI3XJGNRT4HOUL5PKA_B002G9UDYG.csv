Also should mention for people picky about their flippers the particular one i have requires wrist action to fully flip open. gets about half way or a little more open without assistance.

47,AHMQ34UF3JGI3XJGNRT4HOUL5PKA,"July 20, 2017",Columbia River Knife and Tool (CRKT) 7460 BT-70 Folding Razor Edge,this is a big ol knife. Looks really unique. The blade was not sharp out of the box which is a negative for any knife. You will notice right away that thumb stud is really hard to get to. Its actually easier to just grab the end of the blade und pull the knife out. And for reference it is easier to use a nail knick then the thumb stud on this knife. You know what would make sense is a flipper stud or an emerson opener as there is lots of unused steel on spine of the blade. It is cool looking and probably the thickest grip on any folder i own including some of the larger cold steel knives width wise. Also not sure if it was intentional but the grind is not centered on this blade. I mean its still gonna work but for $96.76 i expect better quality control. The knife maker who came up with the design is great and i have no beef with Bob Terzuola but the quality control at the factory seems poor on this one. Coming from a customer who was very happy with the cheaper priced Fossil which is a great option i would suggest instead.

Those are minor things though and that being said is a decent knife. Got it sharp and a lack of coating on the top of the steel liner won't stop the knife from functioning properly. I noticed some people knocking the spydercos made in china and i can honestly say that if you don't want to be spending a lot of money on spydies then support the chinese blades. In the sharpening department the 8cr13mov is really easy to get a solid edge compared to vg10 or zdp so don't be shy about buying a cheaper option.. Should also mention i use this knife in the kitchen quite a bit as well as a carry some of the time, and is pretty much a tiny chefs knife.

Keep in mind you can still mess up your blade so don't get too hardcore. The black coating on the newer cold steel knives seems to hold up much better then the old school paint coating on the aus8a models. The g10 handles are grippalicious and to be honest i don't use the pocket clip on any of my cold steel knives as they are terrible. Other then that the blade shape is really handy the knife is bang on sharp, and after abusing the knife all day i ran it on the sharp maker really quick and seemed to get an edge back quite quickly.

The entire knife has been blackened which i like alot even on the inside of the handle. Although i dont think the coating is as durable as on the PM2, thats what you get with this cheaper line of spydies so im not upset about it. Solid knife for the price, and again if you are worried about the weight i think there is the G10 handle with skelotonized liners and FRN versions. The knife opening is really tight on this knife and requires some working in. I had a hard time opening it with one hand right out of the box, but the knife locks up solid and really isnt a problem for me. Its a really cool knife considering its basically a cost efficient endura4. I would love to see the next endura series with the choil and choil jimping.
