0,AHQSTKY5KPBCSVTA5RL4PPVJXUSA,"July 20, 2020",Parfaites pour le vélo de montagne!,Je suis sorti deux fois jusqu’à présent avec ces pédales et je suis entièrement satisfait. Plusieurs écoles de pensée mais personnellement je préfère les pédales sans clips. Je fais du vélo de montagne assez intensément et les crampons sur ces pédales sont vraiment excellents. Il faut faire attention car ils peuvent facilement faire des bonnes coupures sur les mollets. À surveiller. Je recommande ce produit sans hésiter. Rien à voir avec des pédales plastiques. J’ai le pied large et la plateforme est suffisamment grande pour avoir une adhérence optimale.,yes,0,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Evo-Lu-A18-16-Black-Removable/dp/B004M1PO8Q/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 23:52:30.645236,2020-09-18 23:52:39.924348,Philippe,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
1,AHQSTKY5KPBCSVTA5RL4PPVJXUSA,"July 7, 2020",Tundra 2020 - Pros and cons,"Delivery was fast through FedEx. Product was well wrapped and in good order. Fits almost perfectly for a Tundra 2020 tailgate. I bought the X-Large. Here are my pros and cons if you’re gonna buy this product.

Pros : Standard size bikes are well secured. Easy to load and go. Looks like it can fit easily 4 bikes, adult size, not sure with six bikes though. Looks way much better on a pickup truck than a standard hitch rack.

Cons : Paint on the lower part of the tailgate on each side started to rub off a little bit. I have a black truck, maybe it does not look as obvious on a more light colored truck. Make sure you properly secure it to the tailgate so that it does not look too loose. I added a locking mechanism on it to avoid easy stealing. For child size bikes, you’re gonna want to make a couple turns before tightening it. My girlfriend cannot get the bikes up and down on her own although she is tall. Luckily her friends can help her when they go for a ride.",yes,0,4.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Tailgate-160cm-Full-Sized-Trucks-Black/dp/B07XL1CX21/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 23:52:47.015665,2020-09-18 23:52:54.283384,Philippe,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
2,AHQSTKY5KPBCSVTA5RL4PPVJXUSA,"June 15, 2020",They last !,"I bought these about 2 years and half ago. Thought I’d give a late review and I gotta tell you, they work real fine. I actually installed two of them in the beginning and waited about 2 years to install the next two. They are awesome. I recommend buying these anytime. They are a great addition to my standard outdoor lighting.",yes,0,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/BAXIA-TECHNOLOGY-Waterproof-Wireless-Security/dp/B071HXX16C/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 23:53:04.376967,2020-09-18 23:53:13.649108,Philippe,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
3,AHQSTKY5KPBCSVTA5RL4PPVJXUSA,"April 8, 2020",Huge Tuque,Buy only if your head and forehead combined are over 20 inches. This tuque is way too big. Still trying to figure out a way to wear and/or offer to someone with a major long face.,yes,0,4.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Carhartt-Acrylic-Watch-Black-Size/dp/B002G9UDYG/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 23:53:20.740640,2020-09-18 23:53:30.000734,Philippe,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
