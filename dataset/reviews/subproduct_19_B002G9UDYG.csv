0,AH4ZTEUIRZZBSDRSQEMDIPIJ6OXA,True,Sized up but too big,"I sized up as suggested by many other customers, and now the mittens I have received are too big, at least in the finger box area! My hand measures just over 7 inches around the palm (between the thumb and fingers, not with the thumb) so according to Carhartt, medium fits 7 inches. But since I sized up to a large, I have a lot of excess fabric, at least half an inch worth if not more. They fit in the wrist and thumb portion, but the finger area is a huge roundish pancake.

I'm not sure how the medium fits...it may have been too small on my wrist and thumb, I don't know. I'm keeping these because I wore them once, and I don't want them landfilled somewhere by Amazon. I'll just sew them smaller.

Also, they don't seem ridiculously warm...they are a bit thin to tell you the truth, and I'll wait and see how they do in -30C, because today in -20C I thought they were just passable.","January 30, 2020",Dominique,4.0,2,https://www.amazon.ca/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH4ZTEUIRZZBSDRSQEMDIPIJ6OXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,2020-09-21 09:04:52.108528,2020-09-21 09:04:52.283231,Carhartt womens Quilts Insulated Breathable Mitt With Waterproof Wicking Insert Cold Weather Gloves,No,"6,284",B002G9UDYG,AE6BCAEPXO7ZI3EKDZC3NMS7GDKA
