1,AESS7SGPPXCJTL5G6UBFO7DLPX7A,True,"A really sweet top, well made--washes well.","Absolutely love this top--it would be perfect for summer-- it's very light, almost but not quite semi transparent, and has lots of swing/width at the bottom.
I liked it so much, I ordered the grey, the blue as well as waiting on the orange.
I'm a large/xl, and xl fits well--my arms are rather muscular so the sleeves aren't too tight for me as I've seen in other reviews--my problem area is my middle age lady middle.
I washed the first one--the black in the washing machine and figured--""nothing ventured, nothing gained"", ""do this for the people, HD"", and put it in the dryer. You're welcome. :)
If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam. I actually really like the middle seam--it's slightly darker in some colours, and it looks nice. It's also very well sewed--double sewed flat so it shouldn't come apart.

I liked it so much, I ordered the grey, the blue as well as waiting on the orange.
I'm a large/xl, and xl fits well--my arms are rather muscular so the sleeves aren't too tight for me as I've seen in other reviews--my problem area is my middle age lady middle.
I washed the first one--the black in the washing machine and figured--""nothing ventured, nothing gained"", ""do this for the people, HD"", and put it in the dryer. You're welcome. :)
If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam. I actually really like the middle seam--it's slightly darker in some colours, and it looks nice. It's also very well sewed--double sewed flat so it shouldn't come apart.

If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam.

If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam.

I liked it so much, I ordered the grey, the blue as well as waiting on the orange.
I'm a large/xl, and xl fits well--my arms are rather muscular so the sleeves aren't too tight for me as I've seen in other reviews--my problem area is my middle age lady middle.
I washed the first one--the black in the washing machine and figured--""nothing ventured, nothing gained"", ""do this for the people, HD"", and put it in the dryer. You're welcome. :)
If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam. I actually really like the middle seam--it's slightly darker in some colours, and it looks nice. It's also very well sewed--double sewed flat so it shouldn't come apart.

I liked it so much, I ordered the grey, the blue as well as waiting on the orange.
I'm a large/xl, and xl fits well--my arms are rather muscular so the sleeves aren't too tight for me as I've seen in other reviews--my problem area is my middle age lady middle.

If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam. I actually really like the middle seam--it's slightly darker in some colours, and it looks nice. It's also very well sewed--double sewed flat so it shouldn't come apart.

If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam.

I liked it so much, I ordered the grey, the blue as well as waiting on the orange.
I'm a large/xl, and xl fits well--my arms are rather muscular so the sleeves aren't too tight for me as I've seen in other reviews--my problem area is my middle age lady middle.
I washed the first one--the black in the washing machine and figured--""nothing ventured, nothing gained"", ""do this for the people, HD"", and put it in the dryer. You're welcome. :)
If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam. I actually really like the middle seam--it's slightly darker in some colours, and it looks nice. It's also very well sewed--double sewed flat so it shouldn't come apart.

I liked it so much, I ordered the grey, the blue as well as waiting on the orange.

If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam.

If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam.

I liked it so much, I ordered the grey, the blue as well as waiting on the orange.
I'm a large/xl, and xl fits well--my arms are rather muscular so the sleeves aren't too tight for me as I've seen in other reviews--my problem area is my middle age lady middle.
I washed the first one--the black in the washing machine and figured--""nothing ventured, nothing gained"", ""do this for the people, HD"", and put it in the dryer. You're welcome. :)
If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam. I actually really like the middle seam--it's slightly darker in some colours, and it looks nice. It's also very well sewed--double sewed flat so it shouldn't come apart.

If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam.

If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam.

I liked it so much, I ordered the grey, the blue as well as waiting on the orange.
I'm a large/xl, and xl fits well--my arms are rather muscular so the sleeves aren't too tight for me as I've seen in other reviews--my problem area is my middle age lady middle.
I washed the first one--the black in the washing machine and figured--""nothing ventured, nothing gained"", ""do this for the people, HD"", and put it in the dryer. You're welcome. :)
If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam. I actually really like the middle seam--it's slightly darker in some colours, and it looks nice. It's also very well sewed--double sewed flat so it shouldn't come apart.

I liked it so much, I ordered the grey, the blue as well as waiting on the orange.

If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam.

I liked it so much, I ordered the grey, the blue as well as waiting on the orange.
I'm a large/xl, and xl fits well--my arms are rather muscular so the sleeves aren't too tight for me as I've seen in other reviews--my problem area is my middle age lady middle.
I washed the first one--the black in the washing machine and figured--""nothing ventured, nothing gained"", ""do this for the people, HD"", and put it in the dryer. You're welcome. :)
If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam. I actually really like the middle seam--it's slightly darker in some colours, and it looks nice. It's also very well sewed--double sewed flat so it shouldn't come apart.

If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam.

If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam.

I liked it so much, I ordered the grey, the blue as well as waiting on the orange.
I'm a large/xl, and xl fits well--my arms are rather muscular so the sleeves aren't too tight for me as I've seen in other reviews--my problem area is my middle age lady middle.
I washed the first one--the black in the washing machine and figured--""nothing ventured, nothing gained"", ""do this for the people, HD"", and put it in the dryer. You're welcome. :)
If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam. I actually really like the middle seam--it's slightly darker in some colours, and it looks nice. It's also very well sewed--double sewed flat so it shouldn't come apart.

If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam.

I liked it so much, I ordered the grey, the blue as well as waiting on the orange.
I'm a large/xl, and xl fits well--my arms are rather muscular so the sleeves aren't too tight for me as I've seen in other reviews--my problem area is my middle age lady middle.
I washed the first one--the black in the washing machine and figured--""nothing ventured, nothing gained"", ""do this for the people, HD"", and put it in the dryer. You're welcome. :)
If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam. I actually really like the middle seam--it's slightly darker in some colours, and it looks nice. It's also very well sewed--double sewed flat so it shouldn't come apart.

I liked it so much, I ordered the grey, the blue as well as waiting on the orange.

If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam.

If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam.

I liked it so much, I ordered the grey, the blue as well as waiting on the orange.
I'm a large/xl, and xl fits well--my arms are rather muscular so the sleeves aren't too tight for me as I've seen in other reviews--my problem area is my middle age lady middle.
I washed the first one--the black in the washing machine and figured--""nothing ventured, nothing gained"", ""do this for the people, HD"", and put it in the dryer. You're welcome. :)
If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam. I actually really like the middle seam--it's slightly darker in some colours, and it looks nice. It's also very well sewed--double sewed flat so it shouldn't come apart.

I liked it so much, I ordered the grey, the blue as well as waiting on the orange.
I'm a large/xl, and xl fits well--my arms are rather muscular so the sleeves aren't too tight for me as I've seen in other reviews--my problem area is my middle age lady middle.

If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam.

If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam.

I liked it so much, I ordered the grey, the blue as well as waiting on the orange.
I'm a large/xl, and xl fits well--my arms are rather muscular so the sleeves aren't too tight for me as I've seen in other reviews--my problem area is my middle age lady middle.
I washed the first one--the black in the washing machine and figured--""nothing ventured, nothing gained"", ""do this for the people, HD"", and put it in the dryer. You're welcome. :)
If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam. I actually really like the middle seam--it's slightly darker in some colours, and it looks nice. It's also very well sewed--double sewed flat so it shouldn't come apart.

If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam.

If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam.

I liked it so much, I ordered the grey, the blue as well as waiting on the orange.
I'm a large/xl, and xl fits well--my arms are rather muscular so the sleeves aren't too tight for me as I've seen in other reviews--my problem area is my middle age lady middle.
I washed the first one--the black in the washing machine and figured--""nothing ventured, nothing gained"", ""do this for the people, HD"", and put it in the dryer. You're welcome. :)
If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam. I actually really like the middle seam--it's slightly darker in some colours, and it looks nice. It's also very well sewed--double sewed flat so it shouldn't come apart.

If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam.

I liked it so much, I ordered the grey, the blue as well as waiting on the orange.
I'm a large/xl, and xl fits well--my arms are rather muscular so the sleeves aren't too tight for me as I've seen in other reviews--my problem area is my middle age lady middle.
I washed the first one--the black in the washing machine and figured--""nothing ventured, nothing gained"", ""do this for the people, HD"", and put it in the dryer. You're welcome. :)
If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam. I actually really like the middle seam--it's slightly darker in some colours, and it looks nice. It's also very well sewed--double sewed flat so it shouldn't come apart.

I liked it so much, I ordered the grey, the blue as well as waiting on the orange.
I'm a large/xl, and xl fits well--my arms are rather muscular so the sleeves aren't too tight for me as I've seen in other reviews--my problem area is my middle age lady middle.

If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam.

If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam.

I liked it so much, I ordered the grey, the blue as well as waiting on the orange.
I'm a large/xl, and xl fits well--my arms are rather muscular so the sleeves aren't too tight for me as I've seen in other reviews--my problem area is my middle age lady middle.
I washed the first one--the black in the washing machine and figured--""nothing ventured, nothing gained"", ""do this for the people, HD"", and put it in the dryer. You're welcome. :)
If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam. I actually really like the middle seam--it's slightly darker in some colours, and it looks nice. It's also very well sewed--double sewed flat so it shouldn't come apart.

If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam.

If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.

I liked it so much, I ordered the grey, the blue as well as waiting on the orange.
I'm a large/xl, and xl fits well--my arms are rather muscular so the sleeves aren't too tight for me as I've seen in other reviews--my problem area is my middle age lady middle.
I washed the first one--the black in the washing machine and figured--""nothing ventured, nothing gained"", ""do this for the people, HD"", and put it in the dryer. You're welcome. :)
If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam. I actually really like the middle seam--it's slightly darker in some colours, and it looks nice. It's also very well sewed--double sewed flat so it shouldn't come apart.

I liked it so much, I ordered the grey, the blue as well as waiting on the orange.
I'm a large/xl, and xl fits well--my arms are rather muscular so the sleeves aren't too tight for me as I've seen in other reviews--my problem area is my middle age lady middle.
I washed the first one--the black in the washing machine and figured--""nothing ventured, nothing gained"", ""do this for the people, HD"", and put it in the dryer. You're welcome. :)
If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam. I actually really like the middle seam--it's slightly darker in some colours, and it looks nice. It's also very well sewed--double sewed flat so it shouldn't come apart.

I liked it so much, I ordered the grey, the blue as well as waiting on the orange.
I'm a large/xl, and xl fits well--my arms are rather muscular so the sleeves aren't too tight for me as I've seen in other reviews--my problem area is my middle age lady middle.
I washed the first one--the black in the washing machine and figured--""nothing ventured, nothing gained"", ""do this for the people, HD"", and put it in the dryer. You're welcome. :)
If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam. I actually really like the middle seam--it's slightly darker in some colours, and it looks nice. It's also very well sewed--double sewed flat so it shouldn't come apart.

I liked it so much, I ordered the grey, the blue as well as waiting on the orange.
I'm a large/xl, and xl fits well--my arms are rather muscular so the sleeves aren't too tight for me as I've seen in other reviews--my problem area is my middle age lady middle.
I washed the first one--the black in the washing machine and figured--""nothing ventured, nothing gained"", ""do this for the people, HD"", and put it in the dryer. You're welcome. :)
If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam. I actually really like the middle seam--it's slightly darker in some colours, and it looks nice. It's also very well sewed--double sewed flat so it shouldn't come apart.

I liked it so much, I ordered the grey, the blue as well as waiting on the orange.
I'm a large/xl, and xl fits well--my arms are rather muscular so the sleeves aren't too tight for me as I've seen in other reviews--my problem area is my middle age lady middle.
I washed the first one--the black in the washing machine and figured--""nothing ventured, nothing gained"", ""do this for the people, HD"", and put it in the dryer. You're welcome. :)
If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam. I actually really like the middle seam--it's slightly darker in some colours, and it looks nice. It's also very well sewed--double sewed flat so it shouldn't come apart.

I liked it so much, I ordered the grey, the blue as well as waiting on the orange.
I'm a large/xl, and xl fits well--my arms are rather muscular so the sleeves aren't too tight for me as I've seen in other reviews--my problem area is my middle age lady middle.
I washed the first one--the black in the washing machine and figured--""nothing ventured, nothing gained"", ""do this for the people, HD"", and put it in the dryer. You're welcome. :)
If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam. I actually really like the middle seam--it's slightly darker in some colours, and it looks nice. It's also very well sewed--double sewed flat so it shouldn't come apart.

I liked it so much, I ordered the grey, the blue as well as waiting on the orange.
I'm a large/xl, and xl fits well--my arms are rather muscular so the sleeves aren't too tight for me as I've seen in other reviews--my problem area is my middle age lady middle.

If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam.

I liked it so much, I ordered the grey, the blue as well as waiting on the orange.
I'm a large/xl, and xl fits well--my arms are rather muscular so the sleeves aren't too tight for me as I've seen in other reviews--my problem area is my middle age lady middle.
I washed the first one--the black in the washing machine and figured--""nothing ventured, nothing gained"", ""do this for the people, HD"", and put it in the dryer. You're welcome. :)
If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam. I actually really like the middle seam--it's slightly darker in some colours, and it looks nice. It's also very well sewed--double sewed flat so it shouldn't come apart.

I liked it so much, I ordered the grey, the blue as well as waiting on the orange.
I'm a large/xl, and xl fits well--my arms are rather muscular so the sleeves aren't too tight for me as I've seen in other reviews--my problem area is my middle age lady middle.
I washed the first one--the black in the washing machine and figured--""nothing ventured, nothing gained"", ""do this for the people, HD"", and put it in the dryer. You're welcome. :)
If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam. I actually really like the middle seam--it's slightly darker in some colours, and it looks nice. It's also very well sewed--double sewed flat so it shouldn't come apart.

I liked it so much, I ordered the grey, the blue as well as waiting on the orange.
I'm a large/xl, and xl fits well--my arms are rather muscular so the sleeves aren't too tight for me as I've seen in other reviews--my problem area is my middle age lady middle.
I washed the first one--the black in the washing machine and figured--""nothing ventured, nothing gained"", ""do this for the people, HD"", and put it in the dryer. You're welcome. :)
If it shrunk at all, it was very little--so that was enough to send me back to get the other colours I wanted. It's good to get what you like while it's in stock.
Some folks have mentioned the prominent middle seam, which is noticeable because the fabric is somewhat see-thru, the top has buttons, and you can't get buttons without making seams--thus--there's a middle seam. I actually really like the middle seam--it's slightly darker in some colours, and it looks nice. It's also very well sewed--double sewed flat so it shouldn't come apart.

3883,AGYRCGSKGFUQYYC45H42OBAPBOXQ,True,Hard to tell without trying it on,"Liked the look of it, so decided to try it. I usually take an XL in tops, but I have a large bust, so I ordered this in 2XL, in the dark grey. The colour and style looked exactly like the picture. The front hit me at upper thigh - longer than a t-shirt, but definitely too short for me to wear as a dress. But the overall fit was...odd. On the pro side, it was very billowy without making me feel like I was wearing a shapeless potato sack. Was fitted at the top and then flowed out. The seams, buttons, etc were all good quality. On the con side, I found the area around the seam where the arm is attached to the body of the top (so the shoulder/armpit area) weirdly tight compared to the rest of the top. The neck was a little wide, so my bra straps were visible. And although the back was very drapey and billowy, I found the front clung a bit to my belly. I waffled back and forth on whether to keep it, but in the end, I decided to return it. I think it would have looked better if I had a smaller chest. But one of those things where I think it's hard to tell until you actually have it on.","June 1, 2017",Kirbysaurus,3.0,5,https://www.amazon.ca/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGYRCGSKGFUQYYC45H42OBAPBOXQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,2020-09-28 19:31:50.774187,2020-09-28 19:31:50.898138,Urban CoCo Women's Half Sleeve High Low Loose Casual T-Shirt Top Tee Dress,No,"60,380",B002G9UDYG,AE242MSBRWHV5UWHSG5FCBGBQOFA
