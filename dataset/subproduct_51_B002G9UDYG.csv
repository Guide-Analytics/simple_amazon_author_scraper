2995,AGYS5V4T56SUQSCES3RLF3KTXE2Q,False,"Good Quality, Great Fit & Looks Good On My Husband!","I purchased the Black, Carhartt Men's Hoodie, in size xxl, for my husband, as a Christmas Gift. I really like that it's made really well & is made with quality material. It fits my husband well, even with layers underneath & looks good on him to. He likes the size and placement of the logo's & all of the above. I paid extra for gift wrap, it came in a really durable, awesome silver gift bag with matching ribbons at the top & it also came with a really nice gift card, inside they printed what I wanted it to say, smilies and all. It came a little late, due to customs being backed up, as it was shipped from an American warehouse, as they were sold out in Canada. Great Product & I will be purchasing 2 more. I will recommend this product because of the reason's listed above . I also waited until it went on sale, I purchased mine for just under $58.00 Canadian.
