I usually wear pants size 32x32. Bought these in size ""M"" and: A) they are on a shorter site to begin with, and B) the upper area is very unusual…. it’s sort of ""deep"" so if you were to wear them like any standard-sized shorts, pants, etc. these sort of hang with unnecessary empty space in between. (If you were to pull them up i.e. to make them fit better, then you’d end up having them above your belly button!!) No idea what standards (if any) were followed when these were designed. Perhaps they were made for a completely different market –which was not disclosed to buyers?!

I don't like the thought of wearing them without underwear underneath so I haven't, but that doesn't effect any comfort levels that I can tell.

It's a cool Autumn day outside and I've been walking around out there without getting chilly. If they had pockets and without the fly, they'd pretty much be pants.

6,AEFGV73YDBWPJYF2GGKQFDHQXMFA,True,Not great - very stiff,"Looking at their size chart, I initially bought the small. However, after trying it on, I ended up exchanging it for the medium because I felt it was restricting my movement. I gave the medium a try and here's what I thought:
Pros: warm material, fits reasonably well around the waist
Con: the biggest drawback for this product was the stiffness of the material. I tried it under dress pants, jeans and sweatpants, and what bothered me was that my movement was more restricted by this baselayer than by any of my pants. I really don't think a baselayer should be more stiff and movement-limiting than jeans or dress pants.
I ended up finding cheaper, equally warm, yet much more comfortable baselayer pants at Winners.
