2,2,2,2,AE7U5OXACT6QQSFKSDMXZFGH2OSA,"June 4, 2020",These are mainly motion detector cameras,"This is a first impression review.
I just received this cameras yesterday morning, set them up and ran them throughout the day and night. The review is based off these results.

Out of the box.
The cameras are all well packaged, instructions and everything are clear. It’s all pretty straight forward.
Down the app, follow on screen instructions. Sync your cameras, mount them and you’re good to go.

THE SETUP: It was a very simple setup that literally anyone is capable of. The on screen instructions are straight forward and tell you exactly what to do. Anyone could set these cameras up.

MOUNTING THE CAMERA:
I purchased some additional mounts to allow for more movement of the cameras, but the included ones look just as good. They have a fair abit of movement to them and allows for a good mounting angle of the camera. Other than that I can’t say much because I didn’t use them.
When you mount them, look at a live preview to help you set them up exactly how you want them.

THE APP/SOFTWARE VIEW:
Easy to navigate, simple to use.
On the front screen it shows your cameras, but if you’re missing “preview” of the camera it’s because you have to take a picture with the camera button on the right side of the camera preview. I thought this was a little weird that you had to manually take a picture to preview a thumbnail of your camera. Where the picture saves to, I’m not sure.
If you click on your individual cameras it gives you all the different settings you can tweak from things such as motion sensor sensitivity to length of the clips etc. You can also view your cameras connections as well.
Again, all easy. Most confusing part would be the camera settings if you don’t understand what they are. However you don’t have to change anything.

IMAGE/VIDEO CAMERA:
The easiest way to describe this is that it’s clear enough to see everything, but not clear enough to see details such as a license plate number.
Viewing the camera during the day gives you a good picture that’s easily viewable from your phone. If someone was poking around you’d see it, would you be able to identify the face or shoes they’re wearing.. probably not.
The actual cameras them self are marketed at 1080p, but there’s no way that the image itself is 1080p. Every camera you buy is like this, all the 1080p security cameras wired/wireless are identical when it comes to claiming its 1080p. These would probably be the “best” cameras I’ve personally seen.

CLOUD STORAGE:
I’m not sure how much storage you actually get but this fills up almost right away, you’ll have to set the clips to delete. Tweaking settings will make a huge difference when it comes to this. More storage would be nice or if they would’ve just included a simple sd card storage on the camera.

Here’s a huge note on these cameras that don’t seem to be noted anywhere.
The 2 year battery life is completely based off the cameras simply being mounted, using motion detection, and settings on default.
This is meant for complete minimal user interaction. You’re basically buying motion detector cameras. These aren’t actually live streaming security cameras. You can view the live stream of the camera, but the more you click that button the more battery life it uses. (This is based off of the battery version only)
They’re not meant to constantly be viewing the cameras live. It’s purely a motion detection setup, and the live view is only meant for when you get a notification to check that out.

First OVERNIGHT TEST:

Woke up in the morning to both cameras offline.
It worked perfect all day and even to the point where I was up at 1am. I was really disappointed to see that somehow went offline during the most important part. Why they went offline? Well it doesn’t tell you. No power flickered, connections are all full bars, sync module is on and running with full bars. Everything is located within 5-10 feet of the wifi/module/cameras.
I had to go take down the cameras, remove the batteries, delete them from the system and add them again for it to start working.

Overall...
cool cameras, great idea.. but the batteries aren’t going to last two years with your average user.
It should really be noted that this system is heavily motion detected based. The storage isn’t enough, unless you tweak the settings and constantly delete clips. SD CARD integration would’ve been a huge improvement.
I’ll continue to use these but if they keep going offline, it just renders them useless and will be going back.",yes,One,4.0,https://www.amazon.ca/All-new-Blink-Outdoor-Security-included/dp/B07M8PFGQ3/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-30 20:58:07.975618,2020-09-30 20:58:17.243481,S,Clothing & Accessories,B00T7U6FDK,B07M8PFGQ3

13,13,13,13,AE7U5OXACT6QQSFKSDMXZFGH2OSA,"May 11, 2020","Overpriced, and underwhelming.","We have a two sound bars in our house, an LG and the other is a Samsung. Both of these sound bars were rough around the 100-150$ price range. Performance is about the same, one in a large room and the other is in a bedroom.

I just purchased a new tv, and the sound is horrible to the point that I can’t hear it over people talking upstairs(my tv is a floor down from the main floor)
So obviously the first thing to do was buy a soundbar for some louder higher quality audio.
I just figured I’d spend about 150$ on a soundbar similar to ones that I already have in the house, but I came across the Bose for about $250
I’ve never owned any Bose products but reviews, and people all around will tell Bose is the best.
Sound bars typically last forever, and I wanted a decent one so i decided to spend the extra $100 and go with a Bose product to see this quality for myself.
Honestly.....
this is maybe a 10-15% sound increase over the TVs built in speakers. I almost feel like the bass just gives you the effect it’s louder than it actually is.
Compared to the other sound bars I own, this is equal if not lower quality sound.
Yes, the sound is crystal clear, and the bass is light but it’s there. The remote is massive(it’s a universal remote) which is alright but like everyone else said if you lose this thing, you’re forced to buy another one because there’s no buttons on the sound bar.
It’s louder than the tv speakers even if it’s by a little bit but it’s good audio.

Overall....
This is definitely not worth the $250 price tag.
Bose just slapped their name on it to get an entry level sound bar on the market.

I’ve been printing PETG with overture when I needed a green that I could only find from CCTREE.
This is my first time using this filament and I’m not quite sure what to say about it.
The colour is great, very cool transparent green,and vivid. Now, everything else about this filament I’m a little unsure about.
I had perfect quality with my overture PETG, but when I switched to this stuff I had all sorts of issues. I could not get it to stick to my bed. Typically when you switch filaments because there’s a difference in the tolerances and such...you might have to make some adjustments. I found myself making big adjustments to my zheight to make this stuff stick. It’s also really hard to see anything that’s going on because it’s transparent.
Not only did I have to adjust my zheight when I switched to this brand, I also had to drop or raise the temperature by 5. After all the adjustments I finally got it to print some models. 15 hour print layer, the model looked amazing in this transparent green... except for all the burnt black spots. About 24+ hours of printing with this and I just decided to seal it back up and buy more overture PETG. It’s too finicky.

PROS:
-cheap price
-lots of colour choices, and the transparent green does look great.

CONS:
-too many flaws in the print from this specific filament
-major adjustments needed just to get this stuff to stick and produce a decent print.
-you get what you paid for type deal. It looks and feels like cheap Chinese bulk filament. The packaging looks and feels cheap as well.

This is plug and play, don’t have to mess around with USB cables and configuring cameras.
The picture quality seems really good if you have proper lighting, in low lighting I don’t see this being a 1080p camera like it says it is.
Out of the box the focus was way off and there’s no way to adjust it except by trying to turn the lens yourself. I couldn’t figure out why the quality was so bad until I found out that you could adjust the focus, it made an insanely big difference in quality.
If you have a 3D printer or access to one, go on thingiverse and search up the focus tool for the pi camera, this will save you a lot of headaches trying to manually adjust the lens.
I’m currently running this on a pi4, using octoprint on an MK3S mounted to my x-axis motor.

One big thing here is.. the cable.... it’s extremely short, if your pi is right beside it then you’ll be fine but for myself I needed more length for it to move freely on my 3D printer axis. I purchased a 3 pack of cables and used a longer one.

PROS:
-plug and play
-small camera
-easy to find mounts
-single cable with direct plug in to the board.

CONS:
-short cable

51,51,51,51,AE7U5OXACT6QQSFKSDMXZFGH2OSA,"January 22, 2020",Could use improvements.,"After reviewing several arms and seeing all the positive reviews on this vivid mount I decided to choose this one.

Straight out of the box I could see the parts were of high quality and seemed very strong and sturdy.
A quick flip through of the instructions, and it was assembled in 10-15 minutes.

According to the instructions they want you to assemble it completely and then lift the monitors onto it and mount it.
However I decided to mount the VESA plates first on the monitors and then mount the single arm onto each monitor.
This allowed me to easily lift up the monitor. Place it on the main pole by myself.
After the first monitor I placed the second one on as well.
Adjusted all the angles and tried to set it up perfectly.

This is where it became a nightmare....
Trying to properly align two 27 inch curved monitors was almost impossible. You cannot get them perfect. Although I was happy enough to get them as close as possible.

The biggest problem I had was the monitor constantly drooping. You can’t push the flat, the actual monitor arm has to be angled a certain way to support the weight. This makes your monitors come too close to your face.
I adjusted the spring tension as that what the instructions say to do. Still when the arms were completely flat the monitors drop completely down.
I haven’t had any problems since I raised them high and angled the arms in a way that it supports them. (Almost pointing straight out)
However now they sit way too close and too high up. It makes it a little straining on the eyes playing on 27 inch monitors so close to your face. They’re also really angled and I can’t see to line them up if I straighten them out.

I see a lot of people saying it’s sturdy and not wobbly however they’re extremely wobbly mounts. If you have the arms pointed out at any kind of an angle it wobbles. Walking in my room makes them bounce around.
There’s no way of stabilizing them because they’re free floating on the arm.

Overall: a little expensive, not as sturdy as I wished they were, and they get the job done.

108,108,108,108,AE7U5OXACT6QQSFKSDMXZFGH2OSA,"September 9, 2019",Tastes better than GFUEL,"At a quick glance this is just another overpriced mixed drink with some caffeine in it.

Compared with Gfuel:

-Gfuel is only in the states and the wait time/costs aren’t worth it.
From the few tubs of Gfuel I’ve ordered they all seem to have a generic powdery taste. More of a dull than sweet taste.
Ingredients are all practically the same give or take this and that.

Mixt:
- The taste is way better, it’s sweeter.
-The energy is no different than you would expect from anything else that’s caffeinated.

Rainbow candy actually tastes like rainbow candy...similar to a hard rock sugar candy at the fair and close to a rocket popsicle.

Is this better than Gfuel?
Yes...

Why?
Because it’s cheaper, tastes better, more readily available in Canada. Fast shipping.

Will you get extreme focus and crazy energy?
No. It’s caffeine. You can buy caffeine tablets that are stronger, last longer, and it’s $10 for way more. Now if you’re someone who’s super sensitive to caffeine and bounce off the walls then yeah you’ll be ok with this.

Would I buy this again?
Absolutely because even though it’s overpriced and not really that effective..I still like sipping on a decent tasting caffeinated drink that’s not a “healthier” alternative to a monster.

Install was complicated. Having all the lights tied together made routing the wires a nightmare. If they were on individual cords you could place them all virtually anywhere in the car and route all the wires to a middle point (where it plugs in) instead because they’re all connected. You’re forced to try and make the length and layout work for your car.
The lights are like any other leds, not bright enough to see during the day but at night it illuminates the surrounding area of the lights.

The tape is typically 3m automotive tape which is great depending on the surface it sticks too. Once it falls off it falls off and you’ll have to figure out something else to adhere it.
Using Velcro on the rear seat leds make more sense because there’s nothing underneath the seats to stick them to, at the moment mine are just hanging on the floor. I don’t have enough length in the cables to do much with them. Having a longer cable would’ve been better than having a shorter cable, you could always tie up the extra length but you can’t make it longer.

The music sync and everything is a cool feature that’s pretty much just to entertain my kids, other than that I would just use a static colour.

There's a ton of these kits all over Amazon and eBay so finding a quality one can be difficult. The main reason I chose this one was because of the sata connection. Other led kits come with outdated molex connectors which is no use to most people these days.

The packaging for the product was really nice and well done. I was surprised when it came in a nice cardboard box and then a plastic container inside to further protect the LEDs. Easy to understand instructions and install.

Installation is simple. Plug together all the components matching the arrows on the connector. Lay it out in your case, peel and stick the strips down.
Plug it into your PSU and your done.
The adhesive is strong and meant to be placed on a flat clean surface. This is a bit difficult because it's hard to find completely flat surfaces that the LEDs will fit in. My strips luckily were able to lay out on the inside edge of the top and bottom of my case but not completely flat.
This might lead to an issue of them falling off later on when there's dust build up and the adhesive loosens over time.

Overall the quality of the kit is matchable with any of these $100 brand kits u see in computer stores. It's worth the purchase if your looking to add some lights on a budget.

The only thing I personally didn't like about this kit is that it only comes with two strips, and you can literally buy a roll of strip LEDs for the same price. Although two strips can be sufficient for such a small area, having another two strips could completely illuminate a full size case with no problems.
This would've been better for a case such as mine.
My computer case has a ""smoked black"" window, and when the panel is off the LEDs are extremely bright. However with the panel on they're very dim, another strip or two would've been much better to brighten it up in my case.",yes,6,4.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Super-Bright-Computer-LED-Strip/dp/B01AZ4XX0E/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-30 21:51:15.246906,2020-09-30 21:51:23.551211,S,Clothing & Accessories,B00T7U6FDK,B01AZ4XX0E

It seemed like the best choice for the price range, and considering I was buying this drone for my son's birthday present it was perfect.

It shipped with the wrong plug for the charger ( EU plug ) however the customer service was quick to ship me out the plug I needed.

Quality 10/10
I was amazed with the quality of this drone. The parts are all made out of a durable plastic and lightweight. After a few minor impacts everything held up well.
There were no flaws or anything that slipped through quality control, so Syma did a good job of producing these.

Performance 10/10

I was shocked when I first started up the motors and lifted off for the first time. The power was a lot more than I expected for the price. The motors and controls all exceeded my expectations.
This drone is quick and hovers and moves smoothly. The camera for FPV works as expected and extremely stable video feed from it. The overall quality of the video wasn't as good as I was hoping. Its supposed to be 720p I believe but it looks much lower. Though Syma offers the upgrade for the better HD camera minus the FPV.

Overall:
Flying the drone is a breeze, quality and performance are beyond the price tag.
Camera is what is is, if your into aerial photography or making HD quality videos you may want the upgrades camera or mount up a GoPro. The camera is mainly for FPV so it does that job very well.
