Pros:
Works perfectly with any device including Macs.
Sturdy cable, won't break anytime soon.
Great Value

Cons:
Doesn't support higher than 60hz.

Conclusion:
If you are just an average consumer that wants to use something that will simply output video, then this is the perfect cable. Unfortunately, if you are looking to buy this cable to display something that is over 60hz, then you will be unable to do that. Honestly I can't be disappointed for not having that feature as this was very inexpensive and I heard that you would have to buy a cable over 100 dollars, and that's really not what I'm looking for.

13,13,13,13,AEHUPZHLTNG2MBIMJUYQ7XL6JTMQ,"February 21, 2017",Honest review,"First of all, this was a little bit bigger than I expected, which was my mistake because I didn't read the product description. Honestly not that big of a deal. When it comes to keeping the wallet closed, it's a bit of a struggle as I have to put something on it to weigh it down so it doesn't open up all by itself.

Overall though, a lot of things that were advertised about this wallet isn't true.
First off, this wallet is nowhere near genuine cow leather, and at the price point, that feature isn't expected. The wallet is made of a soft material that does have a good feeling.

Another feature that was falsely advertised was ""RFID blocking"". I could use Interac Tap through this wallet just as easily as taking the card out and tapping it.

I really do think this wallet is more for people that like a larger size. Although the colour scheme in the inside is very ugly, not a bad wallet overall. Although there could've been more honesty in the advertisements, this is 3 stars.

If you want a decent wallet and you want to save some money, this is for you. If you are gifting this to a teenager, they might not really like it or be satisfied.

3 stars, good enough for me.

I do not dislike this wallet to the point where I'm going to return it or just not use it. It might not be my primary wallet, but it's a good backup.",yes,0,3.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Badiya-Leather-Flipout-Wallet-Blocking/dp/B01FJJBMDU/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-30 04:25:11.032996,2020-09-30 04:25:19.348386,Jung Sook Cho,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG,B01FJJBMDU
14,14,14,14,AEHUPZHLTNG2MBIMJUYQ7XL6JTMQ,"November 29, 2016",A few things I don't like about this keyboard is that each row has it's ...,"Very impressed. Managed to get a deal for 10 dollars off because of Amazon Prime

The box was clean, and didn't have any damage on it. When I opened the box, I was greeted with the mechanical keyboard, manual, etc.
When I took out the keyboard, I pulled out one of the keys, and I could see the switch, and it was very similar to a genuine Cherry MX Blue. I plugged it into my laptop, and it worked amazingly. No key delay, and that crisp sound of a mechanical keyboard.

A few things I don't like about this keyboard is that each row has it's own set of colours, and I find that inconvenient. Also my unit seems to have a little bit of a problem, as every time I plug it into a computer, I have to kind of position it in a proper way so that it would be connected.

Nonetheless, this is an amazing keyboard and I recommend this to people that are on a tight budget and wants to find a good mechanical keyboard.

First off it's basically just silicone and plastic, which I can live with, but just how strong are these materials?

Parts of the silicone is already getting harder and breaking off (at least for my unit).

But let's get to the plastic. When I tried to take the case off to clean my phone up, it immediately snapped.

I was disappointed that otterbox uses cheap material for their cases. And I did buy this from an Amazon fulfilled company.
