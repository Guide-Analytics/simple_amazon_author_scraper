0,0,0,0,AEY2SEQGOQKBLB7TOQKBSVAKXLQQ,"December 29, 2019",Just keeps coming back for more. Great inexpensive caliper,"I used this as my main caliper at my engineering job for 8 months. I deliberately purchased a cheap caliper because I was sure that I would destroy it in the first week. This caliper was regularly drenched in hydraulic oil, brake cleaner, axle grease, you name it. The worst time I messed it up was by getting paint on the top where the sensor is. When it starts acting up I take everything apart and clean the feelers and the body up with a chemichal stripper or brake cleaner and a scouring pad, and every time it just keeps working. For the price I’m very happy with this thing. The downside is that it is not the most accurate, and the jaws don’t line up as good as they should. There is also more play in the sliding mechanism then I would like after about 50mm. If you want a good quality caliper, then you have to spend money. For what I needed it for, however, this has been the best little caliper I have ever owned, and it might be for you too. If you don’t need the most accurate caliper in the world, then I would strongly reccomend this neoteck.",yes,0,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Neoteck-Stainless-Electronic-Fractions-Conversion/dp/B074M6LX1N/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 18:42:41.406647,2020-09-18 18:42:47.674054,adrian russ,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG,B074M6LX1N

Awesome quality","It’s awesome feature to have a LNG detector built in, especially for those of us with gas fireplaces, ovens, and furnaces there are so many ways for gas leaks to happen. What I don’t like is that it only alerts for gas at 25% LEL which seems very high to actually be useful, especially since this will be mounted on the floor (natural gas rises) explosive conditions could occur along the roof well before the detector picks it up at the floor. The Carbon monoxide detector however works great as expected and has very quick reaction times compared to the competition. The unit itself seems very well made from high quality materials. Makes all my other detectors seem cheap in comparison and at its pricepoint I have to give it 5 stars.

I know it smells mostly of leather but personally it reminds me of the way the air smelled in the forest while me and my father were cutting black spruce. Definetly something I liked and my girlfriend seems to agree as well. Can’t really knock this other than the fact that it’s not too powerful, which isn’t a bad thing. I would rather have it be subtle and only noticed when I’m right up close to someone than get noticed across the room IMO. Also, the only time this fragrence fits is on late nights and cold days, which limits its versatility; that won’t stop me from giving this 5 stars. It deserves it.

At first it was very quiet to the point where I almost couldn't hear it but after a week of breaking it in it has a throaty rumble to it for sure. You won't hear it from miles away but when your near it the sound is very clean and muscular. Sounds best at about 2-3000 rpm on my crown Vic. Maybe would sound better with duals. At the end of the day this is 40$ that will make your vehicle sound really decent and in my opinion that's money well spent compared to 500-1000 for a custom exhaust system.
