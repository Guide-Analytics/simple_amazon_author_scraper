0,0,0,0,AEZ2ISMJPWKRQCHAOGFFDAYDXEWQ,"June 17, 2018",Faded after first wash. Looks old and dinghy!!,I would of did 5 star but after the first wash they faded drastically!! They look very old and dinghy now. I'm not to happy with the outcome. I wash all my clothes by the tag. Other than that they are great for my little one and his teething days.

2,2,2,2,AEZ2ISMJPWKRQCHAOGFFDAYDXEWQ,"March 16, 2018",I personally wouldn't reccommend unless you like this brand company,"It seems a bit puffy for my boyfriends liking and I agree once I seen it on him. I had to send the first one back because I didn't realize that the sizing in the US are alot bigger than Canada sizing. So i had to get 2 sizes smaller than what I had actually got. So instead of an xl I ended up getting my boyfriend a medium and it still looked big on him.
I won't be buying carhartt in the future ever again.

I completely forgot this in the back of my closet!! I first tired it on him around 2 weeks old and it was so huge on him and I had put it away. I wish I could have used it while I got the chance. I will either regift it or save it for my next child! Great quality. I loved it but my son had no patience as it was tight to put his arms through and zip to it up. This one is 0-3months. I wouldn't reccommend getting 0-3 months because the arms are so small. But id reccommend getting a bigger size. All a baby needs in winter is a fluffy bear jumpsuit and a few blankets to cover while being taken out to appointments.

I had this plugged in ever since and it's March 16th, 2018; 4 months later. I absolutely love it! My son loves it. I wonder how much longer it will last haha. The wipes smell stronger.

I purchased one for my boyfriend and myself fall 2017. It is now march 2018 and thought I'd give my review. We live in a very cold area when it's winter time and honestly they weren't as warm as I thought they would be. My fingertips would be cold. I used mine all winter because I wasn't really outside for long but my boyfriend who spends more time outside hunting, shoveling, etcc.. He needed to buy a whole new different brand. For warmth I do not reccommend.",yes,10,2.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Carhartt-Waterproof-Insulated-Glove-Medium/dp/B005I33OWU/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-30 11:30:22.102465,2020-09-30 11:30:30.540764,Tam&JC,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG,B005I33OWU
