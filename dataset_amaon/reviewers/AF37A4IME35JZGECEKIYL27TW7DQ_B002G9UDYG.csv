Only problem is I've had 3 pair now and each time I get a new pair it's because the screw holding the arm on has fallen out and gotten lost.

1,1,1,1,AF37A4IME35JZGECEKIYL27TW7DQ,"June 15, 2020","My in depth, 6 month review. (It's a long one)","I've had this watch for over 6 months now. Heres my review.
Compared to the original gotcha this version does alot better at:
Battery life- with vibrate and animations turned off the battery lasts me around 2 weeks with about 1-3 hours of use per day on avg.
Multiple devices. I can switch seamlessly between my galaxy s8 and my iphone 6s.
Style- it looks less like a toy bracelet and more like a fit bit.
Heres where I dont feel it performs as well:
The usb seems like something I could break off accidentally- It's usb plug is under the top watch strap, which is challenging to remove without bending the charging port underneath. I broke off the bottom strap accidentally while trying to remove the top. Crazy glue holds it on now.
The original also had alternate carrying options. The strap is permanently fixed to this one.
Additionally: The pedometer hasn't given me any extra adventure sync kms.
The watch needs to be reset periodically to correct the time.

Are you still reading this??

If you've never used a gotcha. My advice is dont expect much. It misses about half the pokemons it encounters. It uses only regular balls so you need to keep those stocked up. It disconnects for many reasons and often for what seems like no reason, but reconnects with no problem. It doesn't work well if your pokemon app is running in the background and even worse if you open other apps.
Using other blue tooth devices at the same time can also cause connection issues.
If it wont connect. Try closing all your apps and restart your device.
I use it when I'm running errands. It will catch and spin while you're driving slow or stopped in traffic, while you shop for groceries or while you sit at your desk replying to e-mails. But if you wanna make sure you never miss a shiny or rare pokemon. Then the old fashioned way is the only good option.",yes,3,4.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Go-tcha-Evolve-LED-Touch-Wristband-Pokemon/dp/B07YQT6QWS/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-30 06:49:11.616067,2020-09-30 06:49:20.967511,Glen,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG,B07YQT6QWS
