Otherwise it's well made, warm and the one I received is made in Canada. I just cannot wear it though.",yes,One,3.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Carhartt-Acrylic-Watch-Black-Size/dp/B002G9UDYG/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-29 22:07:55.373576,2020-09-29 22:08:03.660928,simpleCity,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG,B002G9UDYG
1,1,1,1,AF4YPPK4RKWDWHCBYOEFXJWIYAIA,"August 3, 2017","good lights, very slow shipping","The lights are small, but they are nice and bright. They all worked fine. The only problem is the shipping time. The items were sent out quickly and arrived in Canada in about 2 weeks, but then the tracking stopped. The estimated delivery time was another 2 to 4 weeks at that point. The lights were delivered to me in Toronto a full 2 months after they arrived in Canada.",yes,0,4.0,https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00CDC5ZQC/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-29 22:08:10.765651,2020-09-29 22:08:19.041734,simpleCity,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG,B00CDC5ZQC
2,2,2,2,AF4YPPK4RKWDWHCBYOEFXJWIYAIA,"June 26, 2017",I really like this wallet,"It's well made, looks great and the metal lock seems sturdy. I bought the unpainted wallet. On the downside, the capacity is not great ... 7 cards and 5 bills ... you can put a bit more, but it will stress the lock. Also, it's kind of expensive for what it is. And, if you carry it in your pocket with coins, the wallet gets these ugly black scuff marks on it. I polished the marks off fairly easily, and now my wallet always gets a pocket all to itself.",yes,One,4.0,https://www.amazon.ca/%C3%96GON-Stockholm-Card-Holder-Silver/dp/B00KYBQ1PI/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-29 22:08:29.138307,2020-09-29 22:08:35.438556,simpleCity,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG,B00KYBQ1PI

It did take me and another person like 3 hours to assemble it though.
