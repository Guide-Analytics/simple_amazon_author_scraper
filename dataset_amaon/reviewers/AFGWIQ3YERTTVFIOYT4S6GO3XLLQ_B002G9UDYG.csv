An inclusive package that offers all necessities and more,"My Blue Snowball failed and I had to scramble to get a new microphone. I landed on this one. The mic quality is comparable to that of a Blue Snowball. With the foam padding off and without the pop filter, you can pick up more of the bass in whatever you are recording, which is what I've opted to do. Setup is just plug and play. The stand seems very sturdy, much more so than a discrete one that I've bought for around $20-30. By far the best addition is the shock mount. When I used to use my Blue Snowball on the other mic arm, my every movement on my desk (keypresses, picking up and putting down a mug) would be translated into reverb and make it really annoying for anyone that I was in a call with. However, with this shock mount, this doesn't happen anymore. I don't hear anything besides my voice in the recordings. Overall, for the money (the whole package costs the same amount as the Blue Snowball alone), the value here is terrific.
