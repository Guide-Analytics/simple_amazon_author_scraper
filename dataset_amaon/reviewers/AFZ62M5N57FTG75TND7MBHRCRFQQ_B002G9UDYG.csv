She has a tendency to get ""dreadlocks"" around her hindquarters. I used to pay a cat shaver to come and swipe off the knots for $40 a visit. I just spent that on this product, uncertain as to whether it would work. My cat is not a fan of getting shaved - at all. She's a feisty missy. I distracted her with her wet food and while her nose was in her bowl, I started going to work on a large dread at the base of her tail. Because of the low noise she didn't seem to notice much and didn't try to swat at me once. After a few repeatedly swipes, I got the dreadlock off. I was thrilled.

Helps me sleep through the night and the next day I feel bright and refreshed (and I can feel the anti-depressant and anti-anxiety effects the next day as well - bonus).
