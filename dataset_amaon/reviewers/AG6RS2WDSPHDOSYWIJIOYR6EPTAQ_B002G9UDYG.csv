4,4,AG6RS2WDSPHDOSYWIJIOYR6EPTAQ,"June 2, 2020",Good hat,"I work outside during the winter and this hat is perfect. I have a big head and the hat is fairly big even for me. That being said it was exactly what I needed. Since I sweat a lot while working, I need to wash my hats more often. Most hats tend to shrink dramatically after numerous runs through the dryer which become unwearable for me. It's been one full winter and this hat seems like it will be useable for several more to come",yes,0,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Carhartt-Acrylic-Watch-Black-Size/dp/B002G9UDYG/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-17 21:45:21.849877,2020-09-17 21:45:29.104887,Sean,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG,B002G9UDYG

7,7,AG6RS2WDSPHDOSYWIJIOYR6EPTAQ,"March 31, 2019",Works well,"Works well. Like any properly fitting brace I have purchased, it was a little tight the first time I wore it but it did break in nicely after multiple uses. I use it to play basketball in a pick up league.
