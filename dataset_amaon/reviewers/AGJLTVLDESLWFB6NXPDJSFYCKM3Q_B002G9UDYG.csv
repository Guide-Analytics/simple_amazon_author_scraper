The color isn't as good at a known brand, and the shimmer effect while not bad, isn't good either.

I was doing a fish-less cycle, followed the directions exactly as the manufacturer states on their website, and never saw any indication this product was working. On the Dr Tim's website they state one and only will last 6 months at room temperature's 65 to 85°F and 1 year at cooler temps 50F, however the expiry date on the bottle I received is 8 months from now, and certainly doubt Amazon is keeping this product at 50F, so seems to be you may end up with nothing but overpriced water and bacteria if you receive an older batch, and of course we have no idea what temps the product has been exposed to in shipping, it wasn't below freezing at the destination, but who knows in route as it took 4 days to arrive, so maybe it was frozen in shipping?

If there was a store who sold it locally and I could get a new batch, I would give it a go again, but with shipping there simply seems to be too many variables that can end up killing the bacteria and thus the product not working.

Ill update the review as time goes on and I have more long term experience with it, but so far so good.

Update: October 7, 2016- I have now used the entire first bucket and the tank is doing great and better then it did with instant ocean, and this salt is so much quicker to mix. I have now bought a 2nd bucket, first bucket lasted me about 2 months. 14 gallon nano.",yes,2,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Red-Sea-Aquarium-55-Gallon-Bucket/dp/B000YIYTIC/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 17:54:52.302617,2020-09-18 17:54:58.613019,Zoe,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG,B000YIYTIC
133,133,AGJLTVLDESLWFB6NXPDJSFYCKM3Q,"July 25, 2016",Excellent pump for nano tanks.,"I've had this pump before and they are top notch. Works perfectly in my 10 gallon cube, and is so much easier to hide smaller then the Fluval Sea stock circulation pump which is a lot bigger and more difficult to hide, I will be buying another to replace the Fluval one as 2 pumps work better then 1 at keeping up good flow on the display side.

For the price point this is the best circulation pump you will find in my opinion.It's also not made in China like a lot of aquarium items are, but made in Italy which seems to provide a better quality product overall.

I don't find the 240 bad for a 10 gallon cube when used in conjunction with another pump, not sure I would use just 1 240 in a 10 gallon and up though, but I always use 2 smaller pumps vs 1 larger one so I can get more random flow and for my purpose this size is perfect.

Amazon's price was a bit higher, but with being a Prime member it still came out cheaper then another online store who was 3 dollars cheaper but would have charged 9 in shipping so despite the higher price on Amazon, it was cheaper in the end.",yes,2,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Hydor-Koralia-Nano-Aquarium-Circulation/dp/B0036S4YZ0/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 17:55:07.710121,2020-09-18 17:55:16.005093,Zoe,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG,B0036S4YZ0

135,135,AGJLTVLDESLWFB6NXPDJSFYCKM3Q,"July 6, 2016","Good Products, works perfect for my needs.","I have not put it in use yet but did test them, no leaks so so far so good. I bought this product at it was better price then buying 2 stand alone canisters. The metal part on top is easily removable and the 2 canisters can be detached from one another to become 2 separate canisters.

I am using one for the sediment filter, then the 2 on the original RO unit will have a carbon block each, and then the 2nd one from this unit will have the DI resin, and finally water into the bucket.

I see no difference between this item and more expensive ones.

Only downside is it only comes with two 1/4"" quick release and for what I am doing I need 4, but no big deal, just ordered the size I needed on Amazon.com. The unit comes with a few different size connections of 2 each, but would be nice if they let you choose the size you need and how many, would cut down on waste as I don't need the other sizes for anything so likely will end up in the trash.

Good item for adding on to an existing RO unit, or if you just need a sediment and carbon block but no RO membrane.

No complaints, and I consider this a good product.

This light is awesome, provides plenty of options, makes the colors of the fish and corals pop, fairly easy to use and set up through either the website or phone app.

The only down side is the fact the company who makes it does not include anyway to mount the light, so you have to pay another $40 or so for the mount. But the light is nice, looks well made, feels well made, and so far so good.

142,142,AGJLTVLDESLWFB6NXPDJSFYCKM3Q,"June 22, 2016",Works well.,"Update: Sept 3, 2016

As time has passed this item becomes less and less accurate and the screw to calibrate it also has become near impossible to turn.

Overall, I would say long term this item is not consistent nor accurate. Works great at first then starts to go wonky with time.

So far so good. Seems to work just as good as the pricey ""pet store"" branded ones. Honestly I think these may all be made in the same place, but who knows. I do know this works, and is easy to use and calibrate. I am glad I opted for this one rather then spending 65 dollars at the local fish store, this one looks identical to the one they are selling, I cannot tell any difference between the 2.

I know another review said it had no instructions included in English, however mine came with detailed instructions in English on how to use and calibrate the device. If you don't see instructions check under the foam in the storage case as that is where mine was, kind of hard to see but they should be there under the foam, but even without instructions google how and it will be more or less the same, simple turn of a screw and some distilled water,.",yes,0,2.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Salinity-Saltwater-Refractometer-Aquarium-Hydrometer/dp/B00LAXXYLI/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 17:57:41.066208,2020-09-18 17:57:48.333231,Zoe,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG,B00LAXXYLI
