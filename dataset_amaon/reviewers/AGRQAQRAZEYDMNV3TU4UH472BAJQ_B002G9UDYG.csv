3,3,AGRQAQRAZEYDMNV3TU4UH472BAJQ,"May 23, 2020","Great daily carry, highly recommended for beginners and those looking for a daily writer.","For context, I'm a uni student that usually writes 5-10 pages of notes a day. I write in cursive, my most commonly used pen aside from this one is a Pilot Frixon.

Light little pen. I have never gotten dry nib with this particular pen yet. However, the pen is a little too back heavy with the cap. The plastic construction does not feel cheap, on the contrary, it feels solid and well made. It should be of note that the particular plastic tends to degrade when in contact with ethanol, which is a major downside as I like to wipe down my pens with rubbing alcohol. The nib also tends to slide out and loosen for some reason, which is the only reason why I gave this pen a 4 star rating.

Pros:
- Massive ink storage
- Good pen ergonomics; feels natural to hold, and many different finger positions can be used.
- Good looking pen, clear ink reservoir makes pen much more attractive.
- The nib will never go dry if you cap it. Even if you leave it uncapped it'll still write after 5 minutes or so.
- Great writing nib, wasn't very smooth out of the box but has since smoothed out considerable after a month of heavy usage.
- The nib is soft, has some flex that can be used for artistic flourishes.
- Solid feeling pen, doesn't feel like a cheap Chinese pen despite the usage of plastic for almost all of the pen.
Cons:
- Plastic doesn't allow for the usage of ethanol or rubbing alcohol as a cleaning product for the pen.
- Pen nib slides out under heavy usage.
- Pen cap is too heavy to write effectively with the cap on the back.

Edit
After using it for close to half a year, nibs still writes well and never dries.

However, my nib has started to regularly slide out from the feed. I have tried to slightly bend the nib, worked slightly but still slides out many times over an hour of writing. I have not used alcohol to clean my pen.",yes,0,4.0,https://www.amazon.ca/TWSBI-Fountain-Transparent-Blue-Extra-fine/dp/B07HG5NF36/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-29 16:11:57.627180,2020-09-29 16:12:05.870533,Alan,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG,B07HG5NF36
