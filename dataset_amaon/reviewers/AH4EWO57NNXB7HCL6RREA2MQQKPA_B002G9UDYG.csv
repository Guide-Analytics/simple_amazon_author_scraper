0,0,AH4EWO57NNXB7HCL6RREA2MQQKPA,"January 4, 2019",Not bad for the price,"For those wondering about the authenticity of these beanies, here's a clarification. If you do a quick google search, you will find that there are two branches to Carhartt: Classic Carhartt (workers wear) and Carhartt WIP (Work In Progress) which is the streetwear line. This is a classic Carhartt beanie hence the low price, it is not a ""fake"". The Carhartt WIP beanies are a bit higher quality and go for about 30$. In my pictures, you can see the difference between the the two, Classic Carhartt on the right and Carhartt WIP on the left.",no,0,4.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Carhartt-Acrylic-Watch-Black-Size/dp/B002G9UDYG/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-30 12:45:42.099235,2020-09-30 12:45:50.506826,Tony Quach,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG,B002G9UDYG
