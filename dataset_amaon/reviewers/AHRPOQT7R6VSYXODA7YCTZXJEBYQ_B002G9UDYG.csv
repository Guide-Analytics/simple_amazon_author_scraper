0,0,AHRPOQT7R6VSYXODA7YCTZXJEBYQ,"March 6, 2018",Good set of lip balms for a decent price,"Great selection of lip balms. Each lip balm has it's own unique outlying feature.

Melon: Easily the best tasting one but seems like the weakest for me. I also found it brittle
Lemon: Tastes good and decently refreshing, bit acidic as expected and works well
Mint: Great refreshing feeling and the taste is good
Hemp: The most generic one, it's great if you don't want any flavor and works quite well

I have to put them on multiple times throughout the day. Living in Toronto, lip balms are a must have but I wish these were a bit stronger. I would purchase again.

You can give this keyboard to anyone and they'll have a great time using it. Your mom, your kid and even yourself.

I wish the touchpad was not so sensitive to water. Any moisture on your hands will make it impossible to use the touchpad but that isn't a huge issue (you shouldn't use wet hands on tech anyways). The arrow keys are very narrow, sometimes a pain to use. No real issues otherwise.

Has great range, slim form factor, keys are mushy with low travel and the volume controls above the touchpad is great placement.

11,11,AHRPOQT7R6VSYXODA7YCTZXJEBYQ,"October 3, 2017",Excellent speaker and a joy to use everyday,"Excellent speaker and the simplistic design make it one of the best speakers to buy for the price.

Pros:
- With dual 6W speakers the sound is great for filling up a medium to large room
- I listen to a lot of bass heavy music, quite a bit of rap and RnB so the speakers handles those types of songs very well
- Water resistant so its a bonus for taking it on the go and not worrying about rain/ splashes
- No distortion whatsoever at full volume, other speakers in this price range suffer but this one has no problems
- Pretty easy to carry around, kind of awkward shape for a bag but it still is small enough to carry in a slim backpack
- Design is one of the best parts of this speaker, I use it both flat and horizontally and thats just a bonus that Oontz have thought of. Easy to carry in the hand with plenty of grip. Buttons are easy to press and tactile. Two LED's one for power and another for bluetooth pairing. I always use bluetooth so I have not tested the AUX input
- Battery is amazing, I honestly don't really worry about charging it and I haven't seen any warnings yet

Cons:
- Although the speaker is waterproof and everything, the sound outside is a lot weaker than I would've liked it to be. The sound is lacking in a basketball court or a gym which was one of my intended use cases.
- The rubber sides catch dust very easily, not a huge deal/

So a LOT of benefits to the speaker and the cons are almost non-existent depending on your use-case.

No complaints. I would love to try out the Oontz Angle 3XL someday. I think it is a better fit for me but quite pricey.",yes,3,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/OontZ-Angle-Splashproof-Cambridge-SoundWorks/dp/B01LZV6TYQ/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-30 03:39:07.610794,2020-09-30 03:39:14.917046,Shuaib,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG,B01LZV6TYQ
12,12,AHRPOQT7R6VSYXODA7YCTZXJEBYQ,"October 3, 2017",Bad experience with using it but has potential,"Okay, so I'm not sure if I either have bad luck with meidong purchases or all their products are just not that great. I first purchased the qqChocolate speaker from them which was a dual 5W speaker. It had some minor problems which were super annoying which I don't think is prevalent across all their speakers so I left a 1 star review and requested a return for it. They're sending me a new one so I will test it.

I ordered this dual 6W speaker with hopes that it would do the job. I don't want to bash the company and talk about negatives so I'll talk about the good parts first:
- Very loud, gets quite a bit louder than the 5W meidong speaker I had before
- Nice material choice, the metal makes it look and feel premium
- Very sturdy as well, as in it is strong
- Filling sound, better room filling output than the other meidong speaker and better than the Oontz Angle 3 plus (dual 6W as well)
- Controls work well, power indicator and sound helps with pairing the device and letting you know when it is connected
- Overall, pretty good speaker for the price which I got with lightning deal for CAD $33.99

Now I have to talk about some glaring bad points which directly affects the performance of the speaker:
- MAJOR design flaw where if you are playing sound at full volume, the entire speaker shakes. It shakes so much that sometimes it flips itself over. Now I don't know if my speaker has a weak rubber base or it's a product issue for all speakers but it's not usable. I can't keep it on a table because the speaker will move around and fall off if I play at full volume.
- There is noticeable distortion at full volume, especially noticeable when you compare to other speakers.
- When I listen to 3005 by Childish Gambino at a certain volume, some parts of the songs don't play. It is very noticeable and takes away from the music experience. I've tested my phone with other speakers and this issue doesn't exist with. The meidong qqChocolate works fine with this song.

I either have a faulty product or meidong needs to come out with a version 2 of this product with minor fixes.",yes,4,2.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Bluetooth-Speakers-Portable-Wireless-Waterproof/dp/B071CTB118/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-30 03:39:22.017259,2020-09-30 03:39:28.240862,Shuaib,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG,B071CTB118

I have an assortment of cables, travel charger and pen/ pencils in the front and secondary compartment. With all these things the bag is FULL, it doesn't bulge so it is perfect for me. The bag is also very sturdy, many people don't talk about this. While the bag is full, it stands up straight and doesn't fall over.

32,32,AHRPOQT7R6VSYXODA7YCTZXJEBYQ,"December 13, 2016",Great solution to create a unique look,"Thing's I like:
- Good color output, very pleasing to look at behind my desk
- Easy to get it to set it up out of the box, pretty clear instructions on what to do
- Remote is actually functional, everything works as it should with a good set of options
- Initially set it up cause it look's really nice, but it's also helped me reduce eye strain when working on projects late at night

Thing's I Don't Like:
- Not accurate color's, sure they're nice but could be more accurate
- The power brick is way to bulky IMO, it was kinda a mission to hide it behind my desk

48,48,AHRPOQT7R6VSYXODA7YCTZXJEBYQ,"September 3, 2015","Wouldn't recommend these headphones, broke very easily","I received the headphones in the mail only two days after purchase so the delivery aspect of the transaction was really quick.

Initially I thought the volume control would change the phone volume but it controls the headphone volume only, this could be a con for some people using their earphones with their phones but I am getting just used to it so it isn't that bad. The pause button works perfectly with my Galaxy S5 so I'll say that it would probably work with other android phones as well. Double press to skip a track and triple press to go back to a track also works too.

Sound from the earphones is really good, I listen to a lot of rap and hip hop so these headphones aren't really meant for that but the bass is good and they have a surround sound feel, definitely would recommend it to people that listen to that type of music. I did try listening to some EDM and the songs with really heavy bass sound fantastic. I tested the microphone from the earphones vs the phone microphone, the earphone microphone delivers better quality sound and it sound's more realistic but it doesn't sound very loud while the phone was much louder but wasn't crisp sounding.

The cable length is excellent it's really long and also comes with a shirt clip, it is also a flat cable so it doesn't get tangled as much as regular cables when you take it out of your pocket so there is nothing lacking from the experience there. The flat cable is covered with colored plastic that looks and feel kinda cheap but I don't have a huge problem with it since I only paid $40 for this pair.

The earphones come with 4 pairs of ear tips ranging from small, medium, large and a double flange ear tip. Normally I would use either small or medium ear tips but the included double flange ear tip fits perfectly in my ear and even delivers better sound because of it. One issue that came up with the double flange is that it opens up outwards when I remove it from my ears almost 1/10th of the time, not a big deal but it does happen. The color on the earphones I purchased is also faded in some places but it isn't noticeable it you don't go out of your way to look for discoloration. The earphones also comes with a wrist band which I don't care much about, and a carrying case which is nice but I wouldn't really use it and would just carry my earphones around in my pocket.

Only real con for me is the design of the housing case because it is so big, they stay in the ear properly and don't really weigh much but still seem really big when I look at myself in the mirror. Another issue is that the inside of my ears become uncomfortable after a long time of listen, I tried them for 2 hours and the problem started.

Satisfaction: 1

Update: Like I said before, the housing of the earphones are extremely large and there is only a small spacing of plastic between two parts of the housing which makes it extremely fragile. Today while taking the earphone out of my bag it got caught into a seem and the housing broke. They don't work anymore after 2 months.
