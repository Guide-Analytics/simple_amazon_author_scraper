0,0,AHTTDQQCPWK66C3HZG4PGNFKL2XQ,"April 6, 2020",Not good range,"The range on this is terrible. If I connect a PS4 controller to it and hold it near my lap underneath my desk (PC is beside desk) it will cut out. If you have a clear shot to wherever you are using this, it will work fine.",yes,0,3.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Bluetooth-V4-0-3-Wireless-Raspberry-Compatible/dp/B00E38N7QE/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 13:24:52.086293,2020-09-18 13:24:59.382992,Austin B.,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG,B00E38N7QE
1,1,AHTTDQQCPWK66C3HZG4PGNFKL2XQ,"April 6, 2020",A little small,"It's a decent cheap wireless mouse. I hate the scroll wheel on it, and it's too small for me, though I have large hands. Unifying receiver is a nice touch if you have other wireless Logitech products.",yes,0,4.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Logitech-Wireless-Mouse-Black-910-001822/dp/B003NR57BY/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 13:25:07.475303,2020-09-18 13:25:13.765320,Austin B.,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG,B003NR57BY
2,2,AHTTDQQCPWK66C3HZG4PGNFKL2XQ,"April 6, 2020",Super comfortable,"My girlfriend and I bring this mattress with us everywhere. It's more comfortable than my bed. I wake up with a stiff back quite often, but on this mattress I feel amazing in the morning. It seems thin but I'm not even close to feeling the ground through it (190lb 6'4"") It's a touch short for me but not an issue. It is a little bit large when folded up, if you have a smaller car it may be difficult to transport. It's worth it for us though.",yes,0,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Milliard-Folding-Mattress-Removable-Non-Slip/dp/B00W67PAPK/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 13:25:21.862115,2020-09-18 13:25:30.140665,Austin B.,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG,B00W67PAPK
3,3,AHTTDQQCPWK66C3HZG4PGNFKL2XQ,"April 6, 2020",Great pencil,"I recommend it. Was looking for something like this for sketching, works great. Infinitely better than sharpening a regular pencil. The case is a nice touch and I like the eraser underneath the clicky part. 10/10",yes,0,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Pentel-Mechanical-Drafting-Pencil-Barrel/dp/B000GAU2RU/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 13:25:40.243410,2020-09-18 13:25:47.493405,Austin B.,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG,B000GAU2RU
4,4,AHTTDQQCPWK66C3HZG4PGNFKL2XQ,"April 6, 2020",Great when on sale,"Overpriced, but go on sale regularly. My second pair of this model (I broke the first pair - my own fault). I'm not a huge audiophile, the sound is pretty great to me. The low end is super clean. It may be a little on the weak side for some, but it feels like natural low end and I love it. Very clear sound overall, open-back style headphones are very nice.

Very comfortable, I wear them for long periods of time with no issues. Material quality might be a bit cheap, but as long as you don't toss your headphones around and take care of them it's no issue.",yes,0,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Sennheiser-HD-599-SE-Special/dp/B07RFNZYJZ/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 13:25:57.588811,2020-09-18 13:26:03.897359,Austin B.,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG,B07RFNZYJZ
5,5,AHTTDQQCPWK66C3HZG4PGNFKL2XQ,"April 6, 2020","Convenient, good range","Fairly good wireless keyboard, for the price. Really nice to have the touchpad included on it, as well as volume and media keys. Not sure if there's a way to switch the function button to work for the media keys rather than the 'F#' keys. Touchpad works ok, a little hard to use but its responsive enough. The two finger scroll is awful though, it moves in very large increments.",yes,0,4.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Logitech-Wireless-Touch-Keyboard-920-007119/dp/B014EUQOGK/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 13:26:13.984456,2020-09-18 13:26:20.223782,Austin B.,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG,B014EUQOGK
6,6,AHTTDQQCPWK66C3HZG4PGNFKL2XQ,"April 6, 2020",Very long hat,"Hard to see in photo but this hat is very long. I don't like extra hat hanging off my head, it looks ridiculous. I had to fold it over twice to make it fit nicer. Would rather have bought a different hat, but it gets the job done.",yes,0,3.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Carhartt-Acrylic-Watch-Black-Size/dp/B002G9UDYG/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 13:26:29.309467,2020-09-18 13:26:36.524582,Austin B.,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG,B002G9UDYG
7,7,AHTTDQQCPWK66C3HZG4PGNFKL2XQ,"April 6, 2020",Lovely sound,"These really don't take long to break in. When I got them they sounded fairly good. There was a bit more clanky-ness than I would like and after just a few hours of playing it's gone. It's got a good balance between flat and round wound strings. A good bit of both worlds here. Not too bright, not too dull, not too thumpy, not too clanky.",yes,0,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/GHS-ML7200-Pressurewound-Guitar-Strings/dp/B001L8PK8W/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 13:26:44.614009,2020-09-18 13:26:54.538686,Austin B.,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG,B001L8PK8W
8,8,AHTTDQQCPWK66C3HZG4PGNFKL2XQ,"April 6, 2020",Great mouse for large hands,"I'm so glad I bought this mouse. I have no desire to ever upgrade and I hope it never breaks. It's super solid, it's nice and large for my big hands, scroll wheel is quiet and smooth (smooth increments). It works great, I use it for CS:GO as well as 3D CAD modeling. Great mouse, through and through.",yes,0,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/SteelSeries-Rival-Optical-Gaming-Mouse-Black/dp/B0160USMW6/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 13:27:02.637372,2020-09-18 13:27:11.843952,Austin B.,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG,B0160USMW6
9,9,AHTTDQQCPWK66C3HZG4PGNFKL2XQ,"June 7, 2019","Work for 144hz, terrible colours","Works fine with my Acer GN246HL - had bought a GPU with no DVI port, and had to use this to convert. Runs 144hz great, but the colours are awful on this. It ruins the picture quality, especially in darker scenes, it's absolutely horrendous is darker scenarios.",yes,0,3.0,https://www.amazon.ca/StarTech-com-DisplayPort-Adapter-Converter-DP2DVID2/dp/B00A493CNY/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 13:27:20.948696,2020-09-18 13:27:30.940366,Austin B.,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG,B00A493CNY
