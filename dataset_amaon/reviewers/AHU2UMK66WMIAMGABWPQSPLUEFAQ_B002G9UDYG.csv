1,1,AHU2UMK66WMIAMGABWPQSPLUEFAQ,"August 4, 2020","Overpriced fans with good RGB, decent software and horrible cable management.","Please note: If you have issues with one of your fans and you purchased the 3 pack, you will be required to send all 3 fans back.

The moment I opened the box and saw all of the cables I knew right away that this was going to be an absolute mess for cable management and I was right. It is nice that it includes the Lighting Node Pro but this creates even more of a mess for cable management. I'll be honest, I gave up and I'm scared to look back to see how bad it looks like now.

If you are looking for performance over RGB, I definitely would not recommend these fans. You're paying for the Corsair branding and for iCUE. If you don't care about RGB, look at fans from Noctua. Way better performance and quality for a fraction of the price of these fans.

I will say that the RGB looks good but not 56$ per fan good. It is nice that it is customizable and able to sync with all other Corsair products especially if you're stuck in their ecosystem like I am. I've had the fans set to static teal since I received them and out of nowhere a few weeks ago, I noticed one of the sections of the fan turned blue instead of teal and this issue is also the same with other colours too.

I've been going back and forth with their customer service and I will say their customer service is pretty good considering what's going on in the world. As I said in the beginning, regardless if you have an issue with 1, 2 or all 3 fans, you will have to send all 3 fans back if you're having any issues. I'm currently in a situation where I do not have any extra fans and I need to use my computer for work but without the 3 fans, my computer will be unusable due to temps.

Amazon Warehouse had this monitor on sale for around 115$ I believe so figured I'd give it a shot and I regret it.

The picture on the monitor is okay but the viewing angles definitely have some room for improvement especially this being an IPS panel.

I've loved ASUS as a company for years now but I'm so disappointed in them for even selling this monitor with the stand it comes with. I'm not sure if they collaborated with AliExpress or a local dollar store but the quality of the stand that comes with this monitor is absolutely HORRIBLE. It's built horribly, looks cheap and very wobbly.

While the Epsom Salt and isopropyl method works very well, it always leaves a horrible taste after cleaning it and I normally have to let it sit overnight for the taste to go away.

This product is great! Good price, doesn't require a lot of the cleaner to do a deep clean, smells great and does not leave an after taste.

5,5,AHU2UMK66WMIAMGABWPQSPLUEFAQ,"June 6, 2020",Stopped working after a month and terrible customer service.,"While the mouse looks and feels good, I'm very disappointed in Razer. They promote how amazing their ""Hyperspeed Connection"" is but it's god awful. For the last year, I've been using this cheap $20 wireless mouse from some Chinese company for work and I've never had a connection with it. You'd imagine this $80 mouse with their ""Hyperspeed Connection"" to be even better right? Well, wrong. I consistently have issues with the mouse freezing on me and/or disconnecting whether I'm on Hyperspeed or Bluetooth mode.

The battery life isn't horrible but it isn't amazing either. I really wish they would have gone with a USB charger instead of batteries but in the end, it's not a huge deal. I had to replace the battery once in about a month of fairly heavy usage which I can't complain about.

Now, the main issue is that the right-click button keeps glitching out and makes it nearly impossible to use it in an FPS game like Call of Duty.

I've reached out to Razer last week regarding this and I've yet to get an answer from them.

6,6,AHU2UMK66WMIAMGABWPQSPLUEFAQ,"June 5, 2020",This should be included for free when purchasing a monitor from MSI.,"I recently purchased a 27"" MSI G27C2 monitor from Canada Computers and I've been thrilled with it until now.
To start making some room on my desk, I wanted to mount the monitor on my wall. I went ahead, purchased a monitor mount for around 40$-50$ and once it came in, that was when I realized I wasn't able to mount it as there is no included VESA adapter when I purchased the monitor.

Now, this is my fault for not checking that when I purchased my monitor but come on MSI... I paid 80$ for my old monitor and it came with a VESA adapter so why is it my 300$ monitor doesn't come with one? The fact that this metal plate costs 40$ just shows that this is a pure money grab and they're looking to grab as much money as possible from their customers.

The plate does what it needs to do but I definitely do not plan on purchasing or recommending any more products from MSI.

They say just to turn your lights on and off a few times, it’ll make the light start blinking which meant it’s ready to be paired. Well this took me an hour to get ONE of the lights connected because it kept telling me that there was a connection error. Once it was connected, everything worked fine. The light was bright, great colours but the app is a little bit slow which isn’t a big deal. I kept trying with the 2nd light to work but I ended up giving up for the night.

While I’m watching TV last night, the light are turned off but out of nowhere the lights just started flickering on and off with a bunch of different colours (seen in the video I’ve attached to this review).

Considering this product has great reviews, I’m very disappointed. I didn’t want to give it a 1 star because when it works, the light is fine and it seems like it works for a lot of other people but I’m just disappointed on what I received.

The handcuff pouch is great quality and fits 2 handcuffs perfectly (hinged and/or chain).

About 4 months ago I decided it was probably time for me to start carrying a tourniquet with me again. I wanted to place it on my vest but unfortunately my 3 pouches literally took up my entire vest. Then I realized that the handcuff pouch literally takes up 4 slots on my vest. A radio pouch only takes up 2 slots so why should a handcuff pouch take 4 slots right? I decided to look around and I ending up finding multiple handcuff molle pouches that only take up 1-2 slots so I decided to switch over to another one (went with the HSG handcuff taco).

94,94,AHU2UMK66WMIAMGABWPQSPLUEFAQ,"October 21, 2018",Absolutely love these handcuffs but they rust very easily.,"After over 6 months of heavy usage, I figured it'd be time for an updated review.

When I was originally looking around to purchase my first set of handcuffs for work, the immediate question was Peerless or Smith & Wesson? I ended up purchasing a pair of S&W Model 100s as my primary and also a pair of Peerless M-700s as my secondary.

The S&Ws and M-700s both have their ups and downs. I much prefer the S&Ws because of the two-sided double lock mechanism. Personally I've found that to be extremely helpful when it comes to placing these on someone who is combative and/or resistant. When it comes to applying them on someone, both are very smooth but I find the M-700s are a lot smoother.

After reviewing a majority of the reviews on the Canadian and American Amazon, I think we can all agree on 1 thing. These rust very easily and you can't hide it when they rust. I've basically always used open handcuff pouches and with the handcuffs being exposed to a lot of snow and rain, they definitely began rusting but it's only a visual issue because I've yet to see a slight difference in performance.

If you're looking to purchase handcuffs for work, please do your research because there are many companies (Peerless, S&W, ASP) and different kinds of handcuffs (chained, hinged, rigid). If you're leaning towards a pair of S&Ws, I'd definitely recommend getting these in their nickel finish.",yes,0,4.0,https://www.amazon.ca/S-W-100-Handcuffs-Blue/dp/B0018E5V9M/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-29 19:52:37.984125,2020-09-29 19:52:45.407942,Jacob,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG,B0018E5V9M
95,95,AHU2UMK66WMIAMGABWPQSPLUEFAQ,"September 28, 2018",Decent quality but not made for law enforcement.,"I’ve been using Smith and Wesson Model 100’s for nearly a year now so I was curious to see how an inexpensive pair of handcuffs would preform.

Unlocking the handcuffs with a paper clip can be done by someone with zero to little no experience how to do it due to how big the key hole is compared to a normal pair. Plus the chain feels like a very cheap/weak steel.

This is the biggest deal breaker for me. Zak Tools have keys that give you access to the double locking mechanism and key hole to nearly every single handcuff model out there BUT these ones because the double lock hole is nearly half the size of the size of a pair of Smith and Wesson or Peerless. There’s nothing I hate more than having to be forced to use the regular small handcuff key.

Now, I would recommend these for any kind of use besides that. As long as you’re not using these for law enforcement, they’re a decent pair of handcuffs.",yes,6,2.0,https://www.amazon.ca/UZI-HC-C-B-Tensile-Steel-Handcuffs-Black/dp/B000EVASKC/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-29 19:52:53.514045,2020-09-29 19:53:00.968456,Jacob,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG,B000EVASKC
