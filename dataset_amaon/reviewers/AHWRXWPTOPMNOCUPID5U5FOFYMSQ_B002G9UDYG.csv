I can wiggle the jack around and the sound will come back but it doesn't stay. Also the mint green rubber started to turn yellow and looks pretty awful. I feel pretty stupid for buying them again. Other than the shape and the option to change bud size these are garbage.",yes,0,2.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Koss-KSC32M-Fitclips-Headphones-Mint/dp/B00DE8DB8S/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-19 01:01:14.981449,2020-09-19 01:01:21.295636,katherine,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG,B00DE8DB8S
