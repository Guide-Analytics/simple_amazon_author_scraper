Number of rings needed for your board and preference will vary.

13,13,AHYO26JVHYE3E3XIL6QXDQB6GTBA,"July 11, 2020",Not satisfied,"Reviewed just over a month after purchase.

Chair didn't come with instructions to out together, this could be a problem for some... It was simple enough FOR ME to put together though... Took 20 minutes.

The wheels could be alot better. Mine make a metal sound when rolling and don't roll well at all.

Chair makes a popping noise when getting up or sitting down or adjusting. Not always but often. It is the air/gas mechanism.

Chair doesn't stay at set height long. Eventually the chair will just randomly decompress and air pushes out and you go down..

I wouldn't recommend buying this chair.
