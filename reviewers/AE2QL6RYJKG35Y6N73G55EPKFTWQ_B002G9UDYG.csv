1,AE2QL6RYJKG35Y6N73G55EPKFTWQ,"February 13, 2018",A doll so life-like you'd think it was a real girl,"I bought this as a gift for my niece and she loves it! She loves the way the doll is able to move around and walk on its own. Sometimes, while driving home from my sister's house, I see the doll in the rear-view mirror and have to constantly remind my niece to stop leaving her things in my car. She brings it everywhere so she must love this doll. This doll, however, must love me because I woke up the other day and saw the doll peeking at me through my bedroom window. Of all the places to leave her toys..... Kids will be kids, I guess. Although, if given the option, I would have docked a .5 out of my rating because my sister has been complaining that the doll cries in the middle of the night.",no,0,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Ebuddy-Hermione-Granger-Inspired-American/dp/B01MRMKLL6/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-30 05:42:22.186572,2020-09-30 05:42:30.459047,Nathan D.,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
