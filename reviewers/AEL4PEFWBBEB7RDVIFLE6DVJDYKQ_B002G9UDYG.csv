1,AEL4PEFWBBEB7RDVIFLE6DVJDYKQ,"January 29, 2019",Disapointed with this one,"I was disappointed with this because the last bra I ordered from this company is my favourite bra. Unfortunately, this one seems like a bigger cup, the fit isn't awful but definitely not proper (even though they are both apparently 34DDD) and the sides of it dig into my armpit no matter how much I adjust the straps. The quality of the bra overall is decent for the price if it weren't for the issues mentioned above.",yes,One,3.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Smart-Sexy-Perfect-Push-Up-Blushing/dp/B07BVWZ2V1/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 11:52:12.040280,2020-09-18 11:52:19.320976,Naomi,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG

3,AEL4PEFWBBEB7RDVIFLE6DVJDYKQ,"January 9, 2019",I love it!,"This is great, only cruelty-free deodorant I've tried that actually works and it doesn't irritate my super sensitive skin. I have previously used the Bergamot and Lime one but I prefer this one by far especially because it goes on much easier and smoother. Great smell too that's not overpowering.",yes,0,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Schmidts-Deodorant-Lavender-Sage-3-25/dp/B01851E0R4/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 11:52:45.770370,2020-09-18 11:52:54.030640,Naomi,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
4,AEL4PEFWBBEB7RDVIFLE6DVJDYKQ,"January 9, 2019",Amazing,"I am blown away by how great this face wash is, it takes off all my makeup easily and makes my skin feel incredible.

Also occasionally it seems to leak a bit even if it the lid is on very tightly but this doesn't seem to happen all the time.",no,0,3.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Contigo-AUTOSPOUT-Straw-Ashland-Bottle/dp/B01GKCHKCM/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 11:53:19.492370,2020-09-18 11:53:28.730010,Naomi,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG

12,AEL4PEFWBBEB7RDVIFLE6DVJDYKQ,"April 2, 2018",Love it,I was kind of skeptical that a fairly cheap bra would actually work well but it's amazing!
