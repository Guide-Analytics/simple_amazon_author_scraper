0,AEOEWYAJA5Q35PUKHGZIRKRSHBBA,"September 14, 2020",Better suited for a child,"The chair is difficult to assemble— the actual assembly steps are simple but it's SO tight that it took me and my partner teaming up to get it in to place. Then you sit on it and the whole chair has no balance. You either fall forward or backwards. It's such an unstable, tiny chair. I regret purchasing this. There are higher quality camping chairs for adults than this out there.",yes,0,2.0,https://www.amazon.ca/FE-Active-Ultralight-Backpacking-California/dp/B07QTQ44PV/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 15:11:25.722088,2020-09-18 15:11:33.996094,ilikequilts,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
1,AEOEWYAJA5Q35PUKHGZIRKRSHBBA,"September 14, 2020",Don't waste your money,"Received these & right off the bat the left slipper was significantly larger than the right. I've been developing a shin muscle cramp from trying to walk around with the left foot falling off constantly. In the last 4 days, the bottoms of the slippers have completely deteriorated — the fluff is flat, the front of the right slipper is literally breaking off from the sole of the shoe. I'm disappointed that I wasted $30 on these. Don't waste your cash.",yes,0,1.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Womens-Slippers-Sandals-Leopard-Bedroom/dp/B086D8KDWJ/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 15:11:41.091109,2020-09-18 15:11:49.403376,ilikequilts,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
2,AEOEWYAJA5Q35PUKHGZIRKRSHBBA,"August 22, 2020",👍,I’m 5’7” & 135lbs - I carry my weight in my hips and thighs rather than in my stomach > I followed the other reviews and sized up from my regular medium to a large and they fit incredibly well. The material is like a stretchy legging material and I was worried I’d just bought oversized leggings for a second but they fit exactly as expected. They’re great joggers for working from home or going out. The shape is flattering and the waistband is soft yet somewhat supportive. I feel like I look less bloated wearing these. Giving 5 stars but it should be noted that I haven’t washed them yet so the rating couldn’t change.,yes,One,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/GYM-PEOPLE-Sweatpants-Pants-Womens-BlackGrey/dp/B08DD7T56R/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 15:11:58.495792,2020-09-18 15:12:07.774634,ilikequilts,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
3,AEOEWYAJA5Q35PUKHGZIRKRSHBBA,"November 21, 2019",The tallest hat I've ever owned.,"The hat is warm, well built. The stitching on the logo badge is good. But the hat is SO TALL. If it wasn't for the logo, I would double up on the brim roll. Rather, I'm left looking like I just raided Ethan Klein's hat collection. It's almost comical how tall this hat is.",yes,0,3.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Carhartt-Acrylic-Watch-Black-Size/dp/B002G9UDYG/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 15:12:16.866672,2020-09-18 15:12:24.139465,ilikequilts,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
4,AEOEWYAJA5Q35PUKHGZIRKRSHBBA,"November 21, 2019",Mediocre at best — Hungry for hair.,"I bought 2 and 1 broke within the first week from my shoulder-length hair getting caught in the back. Sad day for my hair and for the dryer. When working, the dryer is passable as a device for drying in a pinch but I wouldn't keep it as your go-to dryer. Sure it dries but it leaves your hair frizzy. You get what you pay for.",yes,0,2.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Conair-246RNC-1875-Watt-Dryer/dp/B004RDQ24Y/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 15:12:31.230334,2020-09-18 15:12:39.532141,ilikequilts,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
5,AEOEWYAJA5Q35PUKHGZIRKRSHBBA,"December 5, 2018","Not sit, kneel, or squat-proof","These pants had potential. The fit and shape is incredible. The length and sizing is easy to figure out & accurate (I am 5'7"" and 125lbs, I bought a small). The pants are see-through though. The material also feels cheap, the pants are not good for the gym as they don't wick moisture at all. They are shiny, the seams are scratchy and weak— and the pants are see-through! I can't even use these as a casual work pant because my butt shows through when I sit down at my chair. Keeping a pair for home lounging but I'll be returning my second un-opened pair. For the price, you could find thicker, softer workout pants for less at a million other retailers.",yes,One,1.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Tesla-FYP54BLK_Small-High-Waist-Control-Hidden/dp/B07DR5TK6V/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 15:12:48.625178,2020-09-18 15:12:56.903902,ilikequilts,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
