1,AESW5KPTQYAWZJGZHDYTI2VTMLZA,"December 19, 2019",Way too big,I ordered a Carhartt hat off amazon and i liked it so much I decided to order 2 more colours. I got a black one and the marled navy one as a gift and they are both about an inch taller and half an inch wider than my other one so now these just fit stupid and I have a big head so I can’t imagine how it will look on the person I’m giving the navy one too. Very unhappy,yes,0,3.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Carhartt-Acrylic-Watch-Black-Size/dp/B002G9UDYG/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 13:15:01.671687,2020-09-18 13:15:10.904043,Nicole Gratton,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
