They feel like they’re made well and it does look pretty sleek upon installing it on my watch. However, the item that I received was a distinctively returned product. The seal of the box was obviously already snipped in half and that one of item wasn’t wrapped. I’m glad that it came in two because the other screen protector already had fingerprints on them before I even I took it out... I just wish I got 2 new ones.... I was at least hoping to get my moneys worth. Anyways, I would recommend getting something like this it but just be weary that you might get a used product like me.

2,AF3HADSSWMSUSJU754GJ7BHJPXKQ,"August 30, 2020",Great backup scrub pants,"I bought these pants as a backup since my other scrubs I ordered from a local workwear store weren’t coming in till a month or 2 from now. So far these pants have been okay. I normally fit a medium but these were way too baggy than I expected it to be so I would suggest to size down. The length is otherwise perfect, I don’t have to get them tailored. These pants remind me of my MOBB scrubs, they are pretty thin and sheer. Anyways, these pants are good for emergencies or a backup, I wouldn’t recommend it for everyday use.

3,AF3HADSSWMSUSJU754GJ7BHJPXKQ,"July 9, 2020",Superb. No cap.,"I was actually really hesitant on purchasing the Full volume one because I have seen other people’s reviews about them being too long etc., etc....but these lashes are life changing. They are very soft and durable. You can probably wear one pair a couple of times and they do hold their shape. I use the duo lash glue with them and they stay on. Like with any lashes, I did have to cut them due to having very small eye. The bands are on the thicker side but I actually do prefer them better. They can compare to $20-30 lashes, so for this price they are a steal as one pack comes with 5 pairs. With them on, it makes you look like you got eyelash extensions and are probably way better for your lashes. They are a bit “dramatic” and very full but I find that they look fine for everyday makeup, no eyeshadow.",yes,0,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/JIMIRE-False-Eyelashes-Fluffy-Lashes/dp/B07T9S1Z61/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-30 13:50:33.208233,2020-09-30 13:50:41.640700,tmariel,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
4,AF3HADSSWMSUSJU754GJ7BHJPXKQ,"June 7, 2020",Great quality!,"I am satisfied with this Kalimba! It included everything that was stated but it was not tuned when I received it. Also, it has the notes/ numbers already engraved on it so I didn’t have to use the stickers. It sounds very pretty and it feels like it’s great quality. This was an impulse buy for me after watching tons of yt videos...I got it on sale so I can’t complain. It was definitely worth my money.

Both of the earphones work! I was really desperate for earphones for my laptop for school since my Apple ones that I’ve had for years finally broke. I am happy with the quality and sound and the fact that the microphone works. They almost feel and look like Apple ones, although it does have some bents in the wires. With the price, I am satisfied and I can’t really complain since they are super affordable. I gave the other pair to my partner and he hasn’t complained.

6,AF3HADSSWMSUSJU754GJ7BHJPXKQ,"May 30, 2020",Awesome pens!,"I love these pilot pens! As a nursing student, I write all my notes down and 1 pen should do just fine for the semester. It glides on the paper smoothly so I don’t have to put a lot of pressure when writing. Therefore my hand is not as exhausted when I have to take down extensive set of notes. I am obsessed with pens and have tried other pilot pens such as the pilot juice, precise V-5, G-2, Hi-Techpoint, FriXion, and the list goes on... this is the pen that I find myself going back to.

Quality is very good and it is very durable. The only con I have is that the inside part of the cover does tend to get dirty easily but that’s with any other cases.

11,AF3HADSSWMSUSJU754GJ7BHJPXKQ,"May 26, 2020",Pretty durable case.,"I’ve had this case for a few months now and it still looks brand new. It is very durable, sleek looking, and keeps my watch safe from many bumps and scratches. I have a small-medium sized wrist and the case is not bulky nor does it add any extra weight, I think that it is just the right size. At first it was difficult for me to install as the case itself is pretty stiff. However I found that taking it off was even more difficult so I just keep it on all the time now. I personally use this case with a plastic screen protector and I don’t really think that it’s screen protector friendly as it is pretty tight around the corners. Since I keep the case on all the time, the underside of the watch tends to build up so much dirt/dead skin and it’s just annoying for me but I know it’s inevitable. I find my self cleaning the underside of my watch frequently. I usually use a cloth and run it across the back of the watch. For the price and the fact that it keeps my watch safe, I’d recommend it to anyone looking for case to protect their watch.",no,0,4.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Spigen-Anti-Chocs-Rugged-Protection-Ultime/dp/B00UVSO3S6/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-30 13:52:50.382357,2020-09-30 13:52:57.799610,tmariel,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
12,AF3HADSSWMSUSJU754GJ7BHJPXKQ,"May 7, 2020",Value Case!,"My case came earlier than expected. It was super easy to put on and it looks pretty sleek. It hugs the laptop at all the right places and feels secure. It also feels like a quality case other than the fact that it leaves so much finger prints. For the price, I’d recommend it. Although, I can’t really say anything about the durability yet as I just got it today. My previous case was more than $50 and it started cracking after a few months. I think it’s just the nature of laptop cases to crack so easily no matter how cheap/expensive they may be.

15,AF3HADSSWMSUSJU754GJ7BHJPXKQ,"October 7, 2019",Best Apple Pencil alternative,"Update:
I really liked this pen that I recently purchased another one because it was on sale ($28)! There’s nothing wrong with my first one which I bought in October. I used it for the sole purpose of taking notes in class (almost everyday) and it has held up to my needs and exceptions. The only annoying thing about it is that it turns off after a few minutes of use (about 10-15 mins) even if it is fully charged but it’s pretty easy to turn back on so I can’t really complain because of how crazy the price is and what it can do.

I found that the tip doesn’t need to be frequently changed (maybe because it’s plastic but idk). I have no screen protector on my iPad and it did not scratch it at all. With about 3 months of use the tip still looks the same as when it came. However, I did try changing the tip and it was straight forward. It doesn’t have any instructions of how to properly do it and I don’t know if I did it right but it still works haha. What I did was just unscrew the top part and pulled the tip with the silver tool it comes with and popped the new one in. Also, I recommend putting a case on the pen as it gives a little more grip and weight to it... I got an Apple Pencil case and it fits perfectly on this pen. Happy shopping (:

This is fantastic. I bought this just to try it out and it is amazing. Palm rejection works! It is a little longer in length than an Apple Pencil, therefore won’t fit in cases with an Apple Pencil holder unless you take the end cap off. I’m blown away with this product. I love how you don’t have to connect through Bluetooth and that there’s an off and on button (saves battery compared to an Apple Pencil). I honestly didn’t like the look of the mesh end, but it’s actually super practical for scrolling and typing. I ended up returning my real Apple Pencil and kept this instead. The price of this is a fraction of the real one and therefore I won’t feel as guilty using it everyday. Just make sure to check if it is compatible with your device and you won’t regret buying it. I am super happy with my purchase.",yes,13,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/TiMOVO-Precision-Rejection-Compatible-12-9-inch/dp/B07WD21V2X/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-30 13:53:58.497152,2020-09-30 13:54:07.943103,tmariel,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
