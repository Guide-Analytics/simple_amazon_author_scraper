0,AFJHP7GYMXORAZGPLJH2HY3VB7YQ,"August 6, 2020",great way to organize pans,"i absolutely love this! i have two of these in my cupboards and it has saved us a tone of horizontal space which we have very little of.
i have one to hold half sheets pans and a cast iron grill. i have another one to hold frying pans.
it takes absolutely no time to set it up, the spacers are super easy to 'instal,' and move around to fit varying sized items. It does feel a bit flimsy but it holds a cast iron skillet in one of the slots and i haven't had any tipping issues and no issue with movement.
it's a necessity for small spaces.",yes,0,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/YouCopia-15017-StoreMore-Bakeware-White/dp/B00VG7VZ7I/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-29 19:17:42.810470,2020-09-29 19:17:50.185000,LivN,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG

these were a gift to my family because I already have a pair and needed to buy these for everyone I know!
they are super handy and everyone in Asia has these hanging in their car for a reason.
this particular set is the most 'bang for your buck.' it comes with the two large double hangers but also four of the smaller hooks. both are great to have for the various items you may want to hang. I use these to transport soupy take-out and wet things that I don't want to have toppled over in my car and make a mess...

I bought it to hold my tech gear when I am travelling or bring a lot of small accessories to work and want to stay organized. I was worried that it would be too small for my needs but it is perfect.

I am using it to hold my Sigma 52mm, lens cap, uv filter, batter pack, camera charger, iphone charger, apple headphones, and there is still a lot of space left. I want to get a travel adapter for an upcoming trip and it is going to fit into the extra space without issue.

It fits in just right but could use just a smidge more coverage at the top as it won't close up fully. I bought this knowing it was a small and may not fit a 52mm so it's not a big deal.
