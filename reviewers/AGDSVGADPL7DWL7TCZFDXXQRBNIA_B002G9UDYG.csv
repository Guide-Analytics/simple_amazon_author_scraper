0,AGDSVGADPL7DWL7TCZFDXXQRBNIA,"October 6, 2019",Cheap,"Not very durable, pretty cheap plastic and and it unclips front he top of my Mac a lot.

1,AGDSVGADPL7DWL7TCZFDXXQRBNIA,"October 6, 2019",Dangerous,"Did not work as soon as I plugged it into my early 2015 MacBook. Not worth the money and should’ve read into all the 1 star reviews on this product first.

5,AGDSVGADPL7DWL7TCZFDXXQRBNIA,"February 15, 2019",Horrible,"I bought these cords thinking they would be perfect. They recall that their made for all iPhones above 4s. I have an iPhone 6s and an iPhone 8 and they will not charge either of my phones. For the first few days the battery would drain from my phone as being plugged into these cords. Then they stopped working completely. I do not recommend anybody to buy these, they are a complete waste of money. Go to Apple and buy your cords.",yes,0,1.0,https://www.amazon.ca/BULESK-Syncing-Braided-Charger-Compatible/dp/B07KC3HQ92/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-30 03:15:46.612039,2020-09-30 03:15:52.881623,Charissa,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
