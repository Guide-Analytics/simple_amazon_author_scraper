0,AGECL6WNRKBRIMEZGJGXCJ6MSBWQ,"April 2, 2020",Its a fan! It blows air! Its basically magic!,"As a aficionado of air circulation devices, I must say this particular contraption is quite up to the task! It has 3 settings for fan speed, but I must say this fan is no slouch even on its lowest setting. That is most likely due to it's size, as it is a 18"" diameter fan. There isn't much else to say about it, stands 19"" tall, about a 6' long cord and it can swivel in its base 360 degrees. I guess the only possible downside is that it is not silent, but given it has larger blades, and is not a $300 plus dyson fan, I can't complain about that. I am quite the admirer of this fan's air movement abilities!

On a lower note, I live in a cold climate and we get a lot of north winds and snow. I was attempting to try and change that this year by setting this fan up outside in the possibility that I could change the weather. Unfortunately, even with this fan's amazing power, it was not up to the task. So if you are looking for a fan to aid you in weather manipulation then this is not the fan you are looking for. If that is what you are interested in, leave me a comment, maybe subscribe and hit the bell while you're at it, and if i come across a fan that has weather manipulation properties I'll get back to you. However, if I really do find one that works you will probably hear about it on the news first or possibly never hear from me again...",yes,One,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Ecohouzng-CT4005G-Velocity-Circulator-Black/dp/B012AN2NFY/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-30 12:41:40.381160,2020-09-30 12:41:46.793313,Jordan Koch,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
1,AGECL6WNRKBRIMEZGJGXCJ6MSBWQ,"March 27, 2020",Child's Outfit,"So this product is a child's onesie. It bears resemblance a bear. The material is quite soft, and fluffy quite like a bear's fur. It fits a child of adequate size quite well and makes them look like a bear. Just on a much smaller scale. A much smaller bear. The child didn't seem to dislike this outfit, they seemed to bear wearing this outfit that looks like a bear. So on all of those criteria I think it suits its purpose just fine. That's why I gave it 5 stars.

Okay so I was really disappointed when this arrived. I got so excited when I saw the picture of the item that I immediately bought it not reading further into it. I was convinced I had bought a real bear... It has been my lifelong dream to have a bear friend just like Christopher Robbins did and I thought the fantastic company that is Amazon had fulfilled it. Alas, that is not the case. It is not Amazon's fault of course, they're still great, all hail Amazon our great overlords. It was really my fault I didn't read. Anyway, to make this more like the real childhood dream I had, I scoured my neiborhood for somebody who would sell me a child to put into this so I could raise a bear friend. After much looking I finally found someone, who frankly, ripped me off with the price they charged, but did sell me their child. Everything was going fine with raising my new bear friend until I found a fatal error in my plan. The child outgrew the outfit, and a child defecating on the floor is not nearly as cute as a bear...",yes,0,4.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Tonwhar-Onesie-Costume-Animal-Romper/dp/B07DZ6RWDS/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-30 12:41:55.895626,2020-09-30 12:42:03.322492,Jordan Koch,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
2,AGECL6WNRKBRIMEZGJGXCJ6MSBWQ,"March 27, 2020",Lovely set of bluetooth earmuffs!,"As a world class carpenter, I used to have a problem with trying to protect myself from the loud noises from nailers and saws while at the same time trying to enjoy the background noise of music. Well all of that changed once I purchased these beauties! They have roughly the same noise cancelling rating as a standard set of earmuffs so they serve that purpose just fine. They are quite comfortable as well. The padding is relatively soft around the ears compared to many earmuffs I have worn in the past, plus there is a rubber pad on the top with a space for the button on a ballcap to fit into if you're into wearing those.

Now for the main attraction, the audio! I have to admit the sound quality of the speakers isn't the greatest. However, considering these are jobsite earmuffs and not high quality headphones I have never been disappointed in what they do. They are loud enough for me to hear over almost anything i'm doing on the jobsite whether I'm listening to music or podcasts. You aren't getting studio quality headphones, but that isn't what these claim to be. They are pretty standard single button use, hold for on, one tap for play and pause, 2 tap forward, and 3 taps back. They also have a microphone for taking phone calls which I have used many times with great success. I have heard people complain about the quality of the calls, but I haven't had an issue on my end and no one has ever complained about not being able to hear me on the other end. I have not ever had any issues with the bluetooth connection as I usually have my phone in my pocket so it's always close by, but I think it has a range of around 20 feet or so.

I would probably say the biggest plus with these, other than being able to listen to whatever you want while at work, is the battery life. I use these for at least 8 hours a day, 5 days a week and I plug them in overnight on the weekend. So I can consistently get 40 hours of use form these without a charge, no exaggeration. I am on my second pair of these (first lasted about a year and a half) and considering they're getting constantly banged around, covered in dust and wet (they work perfectly fine in the rain), I would say if you're looking for something like these they're a great bang for your buck. Especially if you're using them a lot less than I am or even for household chores you should have no issues with the longevity of these.

If you have any comments, questions, concerns, quips, quotations, conundrums or queries please hit me up.",yes,0,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/3M-Worktunes-Bluetooth-Protection-Integration/dp/B0723CYHPZ/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-30 12:42:11.421098,2020-09-30 12:42:20.844355,Jordan Koch,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
3,AGECL6WNRKBRIMEZGJGXCJ6MSBWQ,"July 1, 2018",Best bike rack ever! Not a child seat.,"Wow! Just wow. This bike rack was everything I could have asked for. I use this every day for going to work and back. This is one of the best racks I have ever bought, it was super easy to install and I can put most anything I need on it. Whether I took my riding packs to it or I can also use bungee cords to strap something a little bigger to the top of it. It's very versatile and I'm quite pleased!
The only thing I have to add is that you should never use this as a child seat. I implore you to reconsider your options before you try. I thought that through the use of bungee cords I could strap my 8 month old to this to show him off at work. To my dismay he still fell off of the bike. He's mostly okay other than the dent he has on the back of his head which it very noticeable, but with a hat on you can barely tell. Also he just constantly drools now and I don't think he's going to stop anytime soon. I really wish my wife wouldn't have left me after that, I could use someone to help wipe up the drool at the end of the day, it's an aggressive amount of drool...",yes,4,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/COMINGFIT%C2%AE-Adjustable-Capacity-Aluminum-Bicycle/dp/B01N9OK06C/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-30 12:42:30.949994,2020-09-30 12:42:38.374324,Jordan Koch,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
4,AGECL6WNRKBRIMEZGJGXCJ6MSBWQ,"July 1, 2018","Works great as a drain stopper, might have come from out of this world!","It's hard to decide where to start with this stopper. I bought this thinking it was just a regular drain stopper, but boy was I wrong. First off it performs it's job of stopping water from leaving your sink like a dream. It definitely will not act as a sieve for any chunks of food you don't want going down the drain as it is a solid metal disk.
Now into the extras. My neighbor has a large, unnecessarily loud truck in which he enjoys cruising around the neighborhood in late at night. I became exhausted of listening to the earth shaking rumble of the truck whilst trying to sleep. I decided to try and plug up his exhaust pipe to muffle the sound. Lo and behold this drain plug was the perfect fit and that night I got the best sleep in a long time. Unfortunately the exhaust being plugged ended up pushing the exhaust fumes into the can of the truck and my neighbor got exhaust poisoning. He was in the hospital for a while, but he's out now. While he will be on oxygen for the rest of his life we still like to laugh about the whole thing.
I also have come to the conclusion that this drain stopper might be made by extraterrestrials or part of a government conspiracy. Sometimes I'll be milling around the old homestead and be listening to the sounds of yesteryear on the old Victrola radio and I'll notice some strange noise patterns will begin to play out of it. I thought it was just interference at first, but the patterns are very distinct. This only happens when I had this rubber stopper near the radio. I know it is the cause because I literally put the ratio in an empty room and walked in butt naked holding only this stopper and the radio interference continued. My neighbors across the street were pretty upset about that though, as the room I tested this in faces their house and I don't have curtains in it. I can't see why they would be so upset though, I think everything down there looks quite healthy and is fairly impressive if you ask me.",yes,3,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Insinkerator-STP-SS-Stopper-Stainless-Steel/dp/B00062ASSG/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-30 12:42:48.479778,2020-09-30 12:42:56.881508,Jordan Koch,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
5,AGECL6WNRKBRIMEZGJGXCJ6MSBWQ,"March 10, 2018","Pc user, very happy with this console!","I bought this and to my surprise, it worked great! I popped in a few games and the performance was to my liking, the graphic capabilities were also quite good. I very much like the fact that Microsoft offers backwards compatibility with their products. So having owned an Xbox 360 many years ago I could reinstall games I had downloaded on my xbox live account and replay them. It only comes with one controller, but really it's not that big of a deal to me anyway.

Very pleased with this product, but being part of the pc master race I swiftly burned this in the street to weaken the resolve of console users. It burnt really good 5 stars. However, I wouldn't inhale the fumes are it's made up of a lot of plastic. Also, make sure your gas can doesn't have a leak as you will probably burn your garage down too. If your neighbour's garage is next to yours there's will burn too. They will be doubly upset if they're console fans.",yes,0,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Xbox-One-500GB-Console-Assassins/dp/B075ZNPN4H/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-30 12:43:04.982064,2020-09-30 12:43:13.396593,Jordan Koch,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
6,AGECL6WNRKBRIMEZGJGXCJ6MSBWQ,"March 10, 2018","Great saw blade, NOT A FRISBEE!","After I found out this was a metal cutting blade for a circular saw I became very happy with the product. It cuts thorough thin to medium gauge metal quite nice. It's not the best, but it is great for its price.

I got this in the mail and not having used one before I thought it was a frisbee my wife ordered for the kids. We still have one after the incident so I can't be too disappointed.

7,AGECL6WNRKBRIMEZGJGXCJ6MSBWQ,"March 10, 2018","Very adjustable lamp, very pleased.","I use this lamp fairly often at the desk and I have to say it is quite nice to have. It offers many different lighting options from a bright led to a warm yellow light, all of which can be brightened or dimmed to your desire. So if your a little more sensitive to light you can adjust to however you need, also proven to not be negative towards vampires (so this may not be the lamp you're looking for).

The arm and head of the lamp offer many adjustments. I find this gives it more versatility than a standard desk lamp. Especially while working at a computer you can twist the head away from you so can get rid of any light shining directly in your eyes. It also offers a USB port on the back of the lamp which can come in quite handy.

All in all I have no complaints with this lamp, only positives, other than it not being able to be used against the most dangerous blood sucking monsters in the night. I'd reduce it a star because of this, but I didn't really expect it do serve this purpose. I made my own ultraviolet light for that, I'd give that 5 stars.",yes,30,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/TaoTronics-Eye-caring-Dimmable-Charging-Licensing/dp/B01C3YE0J2/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-30 12:43:35.958353,2020-09-30 12:43:45.391131,Jordan Koch,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
8,AGECL6WNRKBRIMEZGJGXCJ6MSBWQ,"March 10, 2018","Winter hat, it keeps you warm. Not much else to say.","It's a winter hat (toque for fellow Canadians) so not a whole lot to say. It fits pretty good considering I have a larger head, but I know it fits most sizes. It's what you would expect your bog standard toque to be.

It basically has no other features, maybe you could cut holes in it and put it on your dog. However, we all know your dog would hate you for it. Wouldn't buy for smaller dogs though, unless you want it as a carrying sac for them if they're small enough.

Also this won't hold water if you thought it might. So don't use it if you need to haul water, as it will leak out.

If you have a small waist you might be able to fashion it into a warm pair of underwear. Maybe a diaper for a year old or so. I wouldn't use it as a hat afterwards though.",yes,6,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Carhartt-Acrylic-Watch-Black-Size/dp/B002G9UDYG/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-30 12:43:53.498431,2020-09-30 12:43:59.912666,Jordan Koch,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
9,AGECL6WNRKBRIMEZGJGXCJ6MSBWQ,"March 10, 2018","Not pretty, but it works great!","I've been using this lamp for a small while now and I have to say it's been working great. It has 2 light styles (a warm yellow and a bright led) these can both be bright or dimmed. Having multiple lighting adjustments along with it being able to be adjusted to point any which way you want, makes this a good light for both reading and if you need to provide a bit more light into a room.

I can't say it's the most aesthetically pleasing light I've ever seen, but it's easy to install using just a hammer and a screwdriver and it does it's job quite well.

10,AGECL6WNRKBRIMEZGJGXCJ6MSBWQ,"March 10, 2018",Poor design and uncomfortable.,"I haven't used these myself, but I bought them for my father and he's not too pleased with them. The straps don't keep in place very well so you constantly have to readjust them or use a safety pin to hold them fast.

They are apparently fairly uncomfortable as well. If you can find a 4 point suspender for your tool belt, I'd highly recommended you go for that as I find those have a touch more versatility.

These aren't the worst suspenders I've seen so I won't give them a 1 star, but I wouldn't buy them for myself.",yes,0,2.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Tool-Suspender-Point-Padder-Suspenders/dp/B06XTK4W8H/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-30 12:44:24.538883,2020-09-30 12:44:31.958180,Jordan Koch,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG

This clamp had served me well for a while now and the dual rod system is much better than a single. If your stone is slightly askew you can get a much better grab this way. It works for all my stones, but if you have small stones it might not work for you.

The Samsung s7 has a slight curve on the edge of the screen and the screen protector didn't adhere properly on that edge. So most, if not all cases will catch that edge and start to lift it off.

13,AGECL6WNRKBRIMEZGJGXCJ6MSBWQ,"October 16, 2017",Great for sharpening or lengthy grinding.,"I have had this grinder for less than a month now and I have little to no complaints about it. I perform a lot of sharpening and it has been nothing but great for that. It spins at approximately half the speed of most bench grinders I have used, which creates significantly less heat. This allows for longer grinding and less chance of burning the metal. It wouldn't be great for tasks requiring heavy removal or if you are grinding a thick gauge of steel.
