I've never had the issues with pressure or fit others have seem to have, the band is adjustable to a certain degree and cheap to replace if worn out.

The sound in game is fantastic, although coming off of some more studio focused headphones the music experience is less then desirable out of the box.

Thankfully, the software allows for in depth control and allows for multiple profiles to tune each of your experiences.

The mic isn't out of this world, but no worse then competitors in this price range so no complaints on that regard.

I work in an office as a desk manager and I wear them to work with a nice shirt and blazer and the outfit looks professional but let me tell you... it's comfy as heck with the leggings! They are not spandex but not cotton it's a very nice material. The fit was as expected i an 5'2 150 pounds I got a size small... a little snug but I feel like medium would have been too big. So pretty much perfect fit and I used the size guide to determine what size I needed. I believe I picked small because I wear size 27 jeans and the small said 26-27 .
