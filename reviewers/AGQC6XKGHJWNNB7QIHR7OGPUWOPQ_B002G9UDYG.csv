Not too happy, end up buying 3 of these to find out battery life sucks, went camping sept long weekend to find out i basically had to plug these into my power bank the whole time I was there... 12hrs of battery life.... ah no, more like 4hrs.. I understand volume on full blast can eat a bunch of the battery but.... but..... the sound quality and bass is very impressive, should've saved up for the soundcore 2, I hear such good things bout that one...

Update☆☆☆☆
5 stars for Customer service... Anker has reached out to me and gave me an upgrad for my trouble, so the soundcore 2 I must say has an amazing battery life but the sound quality is nothing like the icon... At the end of the day I'd rather have the soundcore 2 its super solid and battery life is what I'm looking for, and with ok sound..
