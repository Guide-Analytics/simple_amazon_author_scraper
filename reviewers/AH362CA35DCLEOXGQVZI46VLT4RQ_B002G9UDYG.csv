But just by feels, the belt material seems super cheap. I have a feeling it wont last long... which is disappointing since Carharrt usually makes really good quality stuff.

Also, I actually bought it so he could use his favorite oakley buckle with it. Unfortunately the holes are so big that his buckle doesnt work with it (his buckle has a little nub that you push through the hole). Oh well! Not carharrts fault, but mentioned incase anyone else is thinking about buying to use with a different buckle that may be the same style. These holes are likely roo big.

Giving a 3/5 for the lack of belt quality.

I will edit review later when it has been worn lots",yes,0,3.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Carhartt-Double-Stitching-Fasteners-Nickel/dp/B01FKGCHX6/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 16:34:45.856192,2020-09-18 16:34:53.146190,emily,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
1,AH362CA35DCLEOXGQVZI46VLT4RQ,"February 12, 2020",These covers are amazing!,"I was going to wait to review this as I wanted to try them out for a bit and see how they held up over time.

I may pop back in in a few months to edit my review on how they are holding up.

I've been using these for about a week and I am super impressed.

When I first received I had worried they sent me the wrong ones because the material was nothing like leather. However, they were inside out! Lol

Then I seen them and thought, 'these are tiny. There is no way they are going to fit..'
I was wrong! I got them on quite easy.

For my chair (which is basically the same as shown in the pic), they fit perfectly. The fit is very snug, but not too tight. Just perfect.
So there is no loose material anywhere.

Then I was worried that when we'd sit on the chairs the covers would slip around. Nope! They are nice and snug.

One concern that I did have after putting the covers on is that where the back of the chair meets with the chair seat, the covers created a slope. Before, by chair had a perfect 90° angle, but after putting the covers on the covers rounded the inside corner (if that makes sense).

My husband and I were both concerned that if someone has their butt all the way to the back of the seat that the cover may rip. However, having sat in the chairs for the last week I'm noticing they are breaking in and there is less of a slope. The 90° angle is almost there again.
At the end of the day, I actually not mind this. With small children now food crumbs cant get into the crack.

The leather like material looks fantastic! Feels just like the leather chair underneath!

The fit is so great, it is really hard to tell the chairs have covers.

A few people have asked if we got new chairs.

Picture shows the chair that has been sat in the most after a week and has been broken into a bit.
I haven't had to adjust the cover at all. It has remained in its place all this time.

My intention was to use these for the next year or so until we could buy solid wood chairs (my children have destroyed the leather underneath. They are all torn and cracked). However, if these little guys keep holding up this well, we may never need new chairs!",yes,0,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Fuloon-Waterproof-Protector-Slipcover-Ceremony/dp/B07GTHC99Y/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-18 16:35:02.243481,2020-09-18 16:35:08.492919,emily,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG

7,AH362CA35DCLEOXGQVZI46VLT4RQ,"January 4, 2020","It was a fun read, but my life hasn't been changed","Okay.
For starters, this book is great if: 1) you have children. 2) if you are hard working outside the home. 3) married. 4) religious.

If you are, this is a good read!

Rachel is very relatable. In that way, I really felt myself in the book and while reading I often thought, ""yup! Been there"" or ""I totally know how she felt"" etc.

That being said, it was just that, for me. A good related read. This book wasnt a game changer, inspirational nor did it teach me anything I didn't already know.

I'm a more scientific person. I prefer self help books that are backed by science and the way our minds works (usually one written by Clinical psychologists or PhDs).

The advice given Is not professional advice. Reading this book felt like I was talking with a good friend. Sure, there were some helpful tips, or it is just nice reading that someone has been in the same place, but I'm no where further ahead than I was before I began the book.

2 things that sort if annoyed me was that she almost seems like she is bragging. She is always mentioning her social media page again and again (almost like she hopes the readers will join her fan club).
The second thing that sort of annoyed me is all she kept saying was that she worked really hard to get where she was. However, she never explained her success and exactly how she got therem

So... it is a good relaxing read. I finished it in just a few sittings. I did enjoy it!
But don't expect it to change your life...
In some ways I was disappointed as I was told that it was a 'life changing book' so I was really looking forward to a read that would actually help me in my personal life, like juggling work, mommying, wifing.

My husbands lenses were very scratched and it sure aged his sunglasses.

We popped out the old lenses, cleaned the frames really good and popped in this new lense. His sunglasses look brand new again!

Amazing price as well! Will likely order more

Edited to add:
We have now bought 2 colors from this seller. Still love them.

One comment I want to add is that they are very ombred. And they have more than one colour. For instance, the last set I bought was emerald. They are only green towards the inside of the lenses and over the nose. They are also teal, blue, then purple.

The red ones do the same. Off the top of my head I can't remember what colors are in it.

So just keep that in mind if you purchase. With the emerald ones, if you are looking at the person wearing them from the side, they look like purple lenses.
