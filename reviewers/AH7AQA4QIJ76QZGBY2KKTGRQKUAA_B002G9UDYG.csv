0,AH7AQA4QIJ76QZGBY2KKTGRQKUAA,"August 23, 2020",Awesome watch,"I've owned this watch for 10 years now and it hasn't skipped a beat. It's a professional dive/tool watch that is tough as nails and scary accurate +/- 1 second a month.
Even after 10 years the tritium is still very bright and easily readable. To say that Iam impressed with this watch is an understatement.

The cool thing about these watches is the fact that you can keep them running forever.
Case dinged up
Sapphire scratched up
Movement dead
Just send it in to Marathon, pay for your parts and labour and your good for another X amount of years. You can't do that with a lot of cheaper watches.

Shop around. You can source these cheaper than what is shown here.",no,0,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/MARATHON-WW194007-Military-Milspec-Illumination/dp/B07F91GN1D/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-30 07:31:24.425151,2020-09-30 07:31:30.679695,Amanda Parker,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
1,AH7AQA4QIJ76QZGBY2KKTGRQKUAA,"February 23, 2020",Excellent EDC light.,"This light is an unbelievable value for the money.
If this light had another brand name on it, it would easily be a $50-$60 light.

Excellent light, the form factor is great, it takes a standard AA battery or a 14500 lithium battery.
For the size of the light the output is great on AA and even more impressive on with the 14500 battery.

At this price it's a solid 5 stars from me.",no,2,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Flashlight-Pocket-Sized-LUMINTOP-Waterproof-Emergency/dp/B07TFS4Z3S/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-30 07:31:39.774121,2020-09-30 07:31:47.059149,Amanda Parker,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG

7,AH7AQA4QIJ76QZGBY2KKTGRQKUAA,"July 3, 2019",I've had better.,"It's a solid well built rail.

But once tightened down onto the dovetail it will lift itself up slightly on one side enough so that it won't sit exactly flush and right on top of the dovetail.
So because it's flush on one side of the dovetail and lifted slightly on the other side it will affect accuracy.
Good for a flashlight etc. But depending on the severity of the gap your scope or red dot could run out of adjustment.

That's my experience. Maybe yours is machined better and it a mom issue for you.",yes,0,3.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Tactical-Dovetail-Extend-Picatinny-Adapter/dp/B01J5EELTW/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-30 07:33:26.863593,2020-09-30 07:33:35.126590,Amanda Parker,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG

10,AH7AQA4QIJ76QZGBY2KKTGRQKUAA,"March 7, 2019",These are a solid go. üëç,"These Black Iridium polarized lenses are great.
I do not like knock off or aftermarket gear. But took a chance and ordered up a pair. It was only a $20 gamble right. Well the gamble paid off.
The fitment is perfect. Snapped right in. The lenses are clear and have that Oakley ""pop''
My eyes can't tell the difference between the Oakleys or the Seek lenses.

11,AH7AQA4QIJ76QZGBY2KKTGRQKUAA,"February 11, 2019",If you are considering it. You won't be disappointed.,"I Like everything but the pocket clip placement. I would have preferred a bezel down deep carry clip.
Other than that this light is very EDC friendly. It's small, well build, comes with a 5-year warranty and absolutely throws the light with 1,800 OTF lumens.
Well worth the money.

Update: coming up on ones years worth of everyday use and it's still everything I said it was above.
