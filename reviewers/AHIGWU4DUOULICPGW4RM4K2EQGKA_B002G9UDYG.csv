1,AHIGWU4DUOULICPGW4RM4K2EQGKA,"January 27, 2020",Nice case,"Good and sturdy case, drop my phone on the concrete within the first hour of having the case and my phone didn’t broke so that’s good! Only down side is the fact that the buttons are reaaaaally hard to press and you don’t feel the click which I find to be a big bummer...",yes,0,4.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Rokform-Rugged-Military-Magnetic-Protective/dp/B07GLV3J3S/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-30 08:58:51.266352,2020-09-30 08:58:59.715362,Emile,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
2,AHIGWU4DUOULICPGW4RM4K2EQGKA,"November 16, 2019",WOW!,"Wow! I normally don't use headphones that much but I do travel a lot by plane so I was looking for a noise cancelling headphone. I'm a pretty cheap person so I was not going to pay for a big brand price. That's when I saw quite a few good reviews about Cowin SE7 and man to be honest I was not expecting such a good produce. First the sound they make is remarkable! Second the NC (noise cancelling) function is amazing in the plane!!! you don't hear the roar of the engine. You do however lose a bit of sound quality, but I've heard it's a normal thing. Third they come in a really nice package with a nice case to carry them around. Fourth they are really comfortable to wear. However, my girlfriend tried them out and they were a little to big for her. So maybe a little too big for those with a smaller head shape... Fifth, the battery on this thing seems unkillable. I've charged them once when I got them and didn't charge them ever since. Finally a very nice thing is that they come with a lot of adaptator! So to make it short: they are definitely a BUY!!",yes,0,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/SE7-Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Comfortable/dp/B07JVRRMH6/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-30 08:59:07.834006,2020-09-30 08:59:16.266732,Emile,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG

9,AHIGWU4DUOULICPGW4RM4K2EQGKA,"May 31, 2019",OK,"You get what you pay for. They're affordable, but the mirror is made of really cheap plastic. The braces are ok. The mirror is really shaky and it's not because of the braces it's really the mirror itself that is the problem. I have a pretty small truck (Dodge Dakota V8 4.7L) and they shake as soon as I start the truck. Solve the problem by adding weight inside the case of the mirror. I didn't expect much and they're affordable, but cheap. so keep that in mind when buying.",yes,0,4.0,https://www.amazon.ca/CIPA-45500-Style-Lowmount-Full-Chrome/dp/B00029WSYK/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-30 09:01:07.425833,2020-09-30 09:01:15.849782,Emile,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
