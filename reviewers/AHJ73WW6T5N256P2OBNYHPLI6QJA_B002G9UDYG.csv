0,AHJ73WW6T5N256P2OBNYHPLI6QJA,"March 15, 2018",Great tool that got the job done,"I initially tried to remove the watch links using a small screwdriver and then a nail with a regular sized hammer, but was not successful. Using the plastic strap holder and the pins made all the difference.Glad I was able to do the job myself and not needing to spend $15 at the jewelry store. Only complaint is that the three pin punchers all have the same diameter, but should still be suitable for most watch links.
Under $5, you don't need to think much before purchasing.",yes,0,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/SE-JT6218-5-Piece-Watch-Band/dp/B002Q8AJSM/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-30 12:14:42.562226,2020-09-30 12:14:51.011194,Vlad,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG

2,AHJ73WW6T5N256P2OBNYHPLI6QJA,"June 5, 2015",Great mattress protector,"Really happy with the mattress protector. I have yet to spill any liquids on my mattress, but I can definitely affirm that the mattress protector feels very durable and well constructed. I ordered a second protector for my sister's mattress as well. I'm sure it will protect my mattress well. Above all, the price is very affordable for the protection it offers.",yes,0,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B006MV7X6U/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-30 12:15:15.646858,2020-09-30 12:15:23.055898,Vlad,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
3,AHJ73WW6T5N256P2OBNYHPLI6QJA,"February 17, 2015",Excellent flashlight and at superb price,"I wanted to buy a cheap flashlight to keep in my car's glove compartment. Can't always rely on the smartphone flashlight app and wanted to have a back-up.
While it doesn't compare to my other $70 flashlight made by Fenix in terms of beam and build quality, I must admit that I was surprised to find out how bright this flashlight is, considering it only requires a single AA battery. The fact that it has an SOS strobe mode and a low intensity function is a big plus. Build quality is quite satisfactory for a flashlight and is at par with most flashlights.
A definite steal for under $5",yes,0,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/UltraFire-300LM-Power-ZOOMABLE-Flashlight/dp/B00IZ7XWA0/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-30 12:15:30.165189,2020-09-30 12:15:39.580522,Vlad,Clothing & Accessories,B002G9UDYG
