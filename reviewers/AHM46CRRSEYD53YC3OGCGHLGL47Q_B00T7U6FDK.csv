I had bought a glove at a golf store with limited stock during the pandemic and it had torn right away - this beats it by far in quality and fit. I was skeptical about the one-size-fits-all idea but the compression works very well and I feel like the glove was fit exactly to my hand, no issue with the stretch. The velcro is very secure, and the material is supportive but breathable where it needs to be - a good combo of the leather/mesh.",yes,0,5.0,https://www.amazon.ca/Zero-Friction-Womens-Gloves-White/dp/B00KSS0T2S/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,2020-09-30 23:43:57.535177,2020-09-30 23:44:06.788419,Toronto Customer,Clothing & Accessories,B00T7U6FDK
2,AHM46CRRSEYD53YC3OGCGHLGL47Q,"July 15, 2020",Great gift!,"Bought this as a bday present for my niece and she absolutely loved it. The material is thicker than your standard canvas backpack, almost feels like a neoprene material. Colours are great and vibrant. If I had to be critical I would say the zipper is tougher for a kid to do up themselves due to the material but she was able to do it when I was helping her by holding it taut.

3,AHM46CRRSEYD53YC3OGCGHLGL47Q,"July 6, 2020",So easy to pop out because of silicone bottoms!,"Wanted an ice tray with a lid as my freezer space is limited and I was tired of using open trays and spilling. These are great, they work like the reusable lunch containers I have with snap locks on every side. I haven't tried to use it tilted or on its side so I haven't tested any spillage but it seems to hold everything in well. The silicone bottoms are my favorite part as they make it super easy to get the cubes out as you can pop them up nicely.

Only had it for a week so I am still playing with the functions and haven't quite worked it out. I like that it has 2 alarm options, a variety of sounds, and several light levels.

12,AHM46CRRSEYD53YC3OGCGHLGL47Q,"November 11, 2019","Great value and cheap, simple alternative to Fitbit","Great value. I wanted a simple step counter without the frills or high price of a Fitbit. This works great. Battery life is very good - I get about a week and a half per charge. The one thing I am not crazy about is that I'm not confident in its accuracy for step counting - I tested it by getting up and walking around my office (approx. 40 steps) and the number did not change. The other feature I like is that you can set alarms on it - I use this in the morning to keep me on track with leaving the house on time, and at work to remind me to take lunch and give me a heads up about 15min before it is home time.

16,AHM46CRRSEYD53YC3OGCGHLGL47Q,"October 28, 2019",Great for on the go.,I've always had trouble storing jewelry in my overnight bag - this is a great solution! Only comment is the same as I've seen from others where certain rings will not fit if they have a stone or if they sit higher than the band.

19,AHM46CRRSEYD53YC3OGCGHLGL47Q,"July 16, 2019",Great option to those without A/C,Works very well! Don't have A/C in my bedroom so this was a decent solution. Been using it the past week and it's better at night in terms of getting the temp down. Really like that it has a thermostat as I use it to monitor the room.
