0,R3S7JH048KOKZD,"The drive works as intended. When I checked on the warranty, it is only warranted until January 2020 (Bought late July 2019) - Just a little shy of 6 months. Be wary with drives purchased from Amazon - they are generally OEM products and don't carry the full warranty as do retail products (That is why the prices are generally lower here and more expensive when you check at Staples or Best Buy, etc. - OEM products cost less because the retailer generally takes care of warranty issues). Not sure if Amazon will carry the warranty as I haven't yet had an issue.

That being said, I have used many many drives and I've never had to return a Seagate drive for warranty. They are dependable long-term and it's usually the brand I edge toward. I have Seagate drives that are well out of warranty that I use on a daily basis (one is almost 10 years old).

This drive series can be disassembled - the drive has a regular SATA connector, not hard wired to be a USB only drive.",Amazon Customer,2020-09-15 04:27:09.927147,2020-09-15 04:27:09.980044,Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive Portable HDD – USB 3.0 for PC Laptop and Mac (STGX2000400)
1,RICEGOXV82050,"As for the quality of this drive I found it to be excellent. I've bought a number of these in the past to use as an image backup and file backup for my computers. I have 4 of these Seagate 4TB drives and 10 of the 2TB Seagate drives.

What I did find with the 4TB drives if I leave the drive connected to the USB port on the computer 24/7 after about 6 to 8 months the drive starts to have some problems. If I only connect the drive to use it for a number of hours, and then store it when not in use it will last for a long time. You will know if or when this drive unit starts to fail you will see the drive read/write light will start going very dim and soon will not work. Then some time after the drive will stop working. As for the 2TB version of this drive type these can run 24/7 for some years and will not fail. I have a number of these running 24/7 for over 5 years now.

I contacted Seagate with the serial number in their warranty exchange program. Without any questions they will take the drive back and exchange it. I did get an email back from them indicating they may send an exchanged drive where they will send a repaired drive unit and not a new one.

I decided to not send the drives back because of any risk for confidential information that is on my drives even though Seagate is secure and is security approved. I was informed Seagate does have recovery service if you agree to the cost.

A fear I have is if the drive gets lost in the mail, and or gets in to the hands of someone who can retrieve the data there is a risk for me. In the past I have had warranty service from Seagate and it worked out very well. I sent drives that don't have critical data on them. I make three backups on separate drives, and thus I would not require any recovery service. Seagate service has been excellent!

Cracking/Busting open the drive case will void any warranties:

I took the effort to crack open the case of the drives that stopped working. I found in all the cases I had it was not the drive itself that failed. It was the small USB to SATA/Power interface board inside that is failing. This small board is is about 3mm thick, about 6mm high, and about 45mm wide. Apparently, there are many people doing this and posting on video sites about how to crack open the case without damaging the drive. This has to be done properly and carefully.

I connected the drives to a USB drive service adapter and ran the full diagnostics. The drives were all super deluxe perfect and would be very reliable to use. The drives I found to be Seagate Barracuda type and of very high performance. They are of standard SATA interface. Seagate drives are highly reliable and of excellent quality from what I found.

I've read the majority of times when these drives fail it is not the actual drive itself that fails. It is the interface module inside of the case. I've had this also happen with the full size externally powered USB backup drives. I crack open the case and install the drives in to a new external universal type drive case. I've also installed them in to computers to use as an internal drive and they ran for some years. This also applies to other manufacture drives.

I bought external drive cases with power supply and USB3 connection for each of these drives. They can also be mounted inside of the computer and used as an internal drive. Take care the 4TB drives are thicker than the 2TB drives and require a thicker external drive case. They will work well in a full size external drive case, but will require some customized mounting. If you were to install this type of drive inside of a PC it would be a very fast drive. Impressive performance! You may require a drive mounting adapter to mount the drive in a 3.5"" form factor bay depending on the type of options in the computer case.",Jerryg50,2020-09-15 04:27:09.984997,2020-09-15 04:27:10.033763,Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive Portable HDD – USB 3.0 for PC Laptop and Mac (STGX2000400)
2,RPZMRFSL4MBC7,"These perform ok, until they are about half full, then they start shingling the information (SMR), and performance just goes through the floor. This is due to it reading data, so that it can write the new data, with the existing data.

Basically in laymens terms, these seem great for ~3tb, once you fill it past there, write speeds go from 100+mb/s to <1-2mb/s after the buffer fills up.

I copied 60gb of home videos to it once it reached 50% filled, and its now at 6 hours of copying. Worse still it causes the entire computer to hang, as it has no idea why the drive just stops responding.

Avoid these smr drives, they're junk.",CdnHockeyDude,2020-09-15 04:27:10.038478,2020-09-15 04:27:10.088737,Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive Portable HDD – USB 3.0 for PC Laptop and Mac (STGX2000400)
3,R3GAYMBI3LBNV6,"Don't get scared as I did about the cartoon box without Seagate labels and the drive in a clear plastic box that didn't say anything. The reason it's so cheap and doesn't come in a Seagate box is because it's a OEM product, it's intended to be bundled to other products from other companies. Anyways I checked the model number and corresponds to an existing Seagate model, the same as advertised. And to make sure, I tried to register the serial number and it works, there is no way a fake could copy all the non registered serial numbers into their products.",Amazon Customer,2020-09-15 04:27:10.093743,2020-09-15 04:27:10.142004,Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive Portable HDD – USB 3.0 for PC Laptop and Mac (STGX2000400)
4,RZHOG0289MVKF,"The overall construct felt very plastic and fragile, very different from the previous Seagate portable hard drives I own.

12,R3S828LTJQ7115,"So the first thing I noted on my device was that it had no power button. Because of this I knocked off 2 stars from portability. If you are looking for an off-line/cold backup disk it is kind of a pain to have to physically unplug the drive to shut it off.

For those of you interested in the speed of this drive I didn't run bench marks but instead decided to put it through real-world use case of backing up files.

I took an assortment of data ranging from pictures, documents audio files, isos etc and timed the transfer from a server running ZFS with 2 mirrored pairs (4 X 4TB NAS drives). This data was approximately 245GiB. It took 31M 54s to complete

Rough math breaks that down to approximately 7.7 GiB/minute or 127MiB/second

Next I took media files that were all over several hundred MiB. I transferred 8.5TB in 15.3 hours.

That is roughly 555GiB/hour or 9.25GiB/minute or 154MiB/second

I thought this was impressive that over 15 hours the drive did not suffer any speed slow down on the big files.

From the hardware, the case is ok, but it lacks any active cooling and the case itself feels like plastic. That means it does not do a fantastic job of dissipating the heat. As I do not plan on using this drive constantly, but rather as a drive that goes in a fireproof safe, this is acceptable.

NOTE: the command 'blockdev --getbsz /dev/sdd' which gets the physical block sizes of the drive reported 512 bytes. I'm shocked at this as I thought most modern drives had moved to at least 4096.

Overall this drive performs well for the price and will serve its purpose",Steve O,2020-09-15 04:27:12.740323,2020-09-15 04:27:12.792136,Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive Portable HDD – USB 3.0 for PC Laptop and Mac (STGX2000400)
13,R18IBG059S3HPC,I've now tried the 2Tb Seagate and the 4Tb and have to return both. I've tried 1 usb hub and even a brand new usb hub. I even tried it on 2 different PCs. After about 200 files this drive keeps disconnecting and giving me errors (not my source). I've tried now 5 times to simply get 350 files copied onto it. Since these do not have real boxes these are clearly fakes. I will go to Best Buy to buy a real one.,M.

14,RI3QVPQYKVJAZ,"This seemed to be to good to be true: $130 for 4TB on a portable expernal drive!

Yes, it is. Performance great writing to this drive up to about 2TB. Beyond that, write performance goes down tremendously! My average write to external USB3.0 drives is usually 80 to 100 MBps. Once filled to about 2TB, it craps out to about 20 MBps! I re-initialed it and created two partitions of about 2.0TB each. Same performance on overall drive capacity reaching 2.0TB.

Perhaps my drive is defective, but it is truly an inferior product. Don't buy this!",MICHEL R COUTU,2020-09-15 04:27:12.853997,2020-09-15 04:27:12.904501,Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive Portable HDD – USB 3.0 for PC Laptop and Mac (STGX2000400)
15,R3GX609AILJZSF,"I bought two of these NTFS drives and returned one because of low performance with write speeds. When I investigated the write speeds, I found and identical drive had much poorer performance than another and therefore returned the slow drive. See below:

Slow drive: Timing buffered disk reads: 10 MB in 3.81 seconds = 2.63 MB/sec
Fast drive: Timing buffered disk reads: 94 MB in 3.05 seconds = 30.83 MB/sec

It turns out, that after transferring files, the drive performs some sort of activity until it recovers. I don't know what the drive is doing but may be performing some kind of SMR activity (Shingled magnetic recording (SMR)), indexing or buffering.

The problem with this recovery period, is the drive becomes almost unusable while this process is occurring. The drive also causes your computer to stall while rebooting as the OS waits for the drive. I addition, the drive will take an uncomfortably long time to mount upon startup.

I have not experienced this behavior on any of my dozens of hard drives, but perhaps the technology is reaching some limit at 5TB.

In conclusion, if you find a drive has very poor write speeds, keep the drive instead of returning it to Amazon. This experience is bizarre to say the least and I would like to know more about how it occurs, but I am very pleased with the hard drive regardless because of it's large capacity and price.",j,2020-09-15 04:27:12.909488,2020-09-15 04:27:12.961467,Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive Portable HDD – USB 3.0 for PC Laptop and Mac (STGX2000400)

17,R1F1OE9RKSL3VI,"This external hard drives works pretty well. I initially had some issues with it maintaining its write speed but I guess they have magically disappeared over a few days. It has decent write speeds, hitting a peak of ~100MB/s. Please note that under sustained load, this thing gets hot. Almost burn your skin hot. Not sure how that will affect the lifespan of the drive, but usually heat + electronics are a bad combination. Hoping that this lasts well past it's warranty expiration; I know my data is more valuable to me than the money I paid for this drive. If you need something faster, look to invest in an external SSD instead.
