0,AEO47ULOBUQ3ENNJSXVILH4F44LQ,True,Paper thin,"Just received and tried on. Nice baggy/loose fit, but man, didn't even know u could make a pant this thin.

'IF', big IF, I keep them I don't expect them to make it more than a few months before falling apart.
Writing this review, I believe I may have just talked myself out of keeping them.","December 1, 2018",allin4once,3.0,One,https://www.amazon.ca/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEO47ULOBUQ3ENNJSXVILH4F44LQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,2020-10-05 19:00:46.408080,2020-10-05 19:00:46.582822,White Sierra Men's Trabagon Pant,White Sierra,"136,614",B002G9UDYG,AEBQALN7ZMWCPRRBTRQ7FN2EPPHQ,B002QGHM8O
