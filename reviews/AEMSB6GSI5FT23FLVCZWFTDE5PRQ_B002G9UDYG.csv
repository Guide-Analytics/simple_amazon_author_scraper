1,AFCWIFSEEKE75B2E5GDWFSA22HEQ,True,Good value and decent quality,"Pros:
1) great value - you get three bras for the cost of one nursing bra
2) extenders included
3) soft, stretchy and comfortable material

Cons:
1) padding gets in the way when you unhook to nurse especially if you use disposable nursing pads; I removed them
2) not low cut so bra is visible under scoop neck or v-neck shirts
3) the latch to unhook while nursing doesn't click and unclick as easily as other nursing bras but still doable (and ok given the price)

2,AE7VILWQPARAELDJS5VCV37DO2DA,True,Worth the Price,"I measure 31 inches under the bust, and 37 inches around the fullest part of the bust.

I purchased the ""small"" size.

Fits very well; not perfectly, but well.

Similar to the bras you can buy at Motherhood or Thyme.

Very stretchy. Seems small at first look, but stretches to fit.

Supports pretty well for a bra with no underwire.

90% Nylon; 10% Spandex: so not very breathable, but that was expected.

My problem is finding a band that is small enough that it will still fit if the bra stretches. I have to wear this one on the smallest hook for a secure fit, so this bra probably won't fit well after time goes by and it stretches out.

Some of the stiching is not perfect, but overall it is a great buy for the price!","September 27, 2017",M-R Mc,5.0,14,https://www.amazon.ca/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE7VILWQPARAELDJS5VCV37DO2DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,2020-10-05 20:49:31.597445,2020-10-05 20:49:31.746796,YIANNA Women’s Maternity Nursing Bra Breathable Wireless Breastfeeding Bra 3PACK,No,"31,391",B002G9UDYG,AEMSB6GSI5FT23FLVCZWFTDE5PRQ,B01KT2SZTG

I got a size small which is my pregnancy size, but at the moment currently 32 weeks. I also know the material will stretch over time, but initially it fits snug around the band. I found it a tiny bit uncomfortable to wear for extended period of time only because I am pregnant. But it is exactly what I was looking for and post partum I know I will appreciate the tight fit. A tad small in the bust but very stretchy material. Once broken in should be comfortable. Hopefully will fit once I start breastfeeding because of the change in size. Overall definitely recommend!!

They fit so nicely around the band, it doesn't dig into your skin at all. The material is stretchy so there's room for engorgement. They do have those triangular inserts in the inner lining (like some swimsuits do) but if you don't like them you can take them out. There is a slit to do so.
I just wish I had bought these sooner! They would have been awesome to have in the hospital when babybear was born as they don't have an underwire but are still nice and supportive.

I tightened the straps and I found it comfortable and not too bouncy.
