0,AGBJ25PQV2NQMVX4DJ7BFR4MIL3A,True,Omg amazing!,"Avid Lululemon fan here, with many a-thousands spent on my prized Lulus. These pants are as close to a dupe of Lulu Align joggers I’ve found so far, and for 1/4 of the price. Sure, they’re not that exact buttery soft feeling of their fabric, but they’re pretty damn close (far better than mall brand dupes)! And tbh the material feels like one that’s actually NOT going to pill in high-contact areas.

I’ve put these on when I got them today, and I’m pretty certain I’ll be living in them in the coming months. They’re the perfect blend of jogger/legging that looks great with whatever on top. Perfect for working from home, walking the dog, or anything in between. I will certainly be buying more colours.

I'm 5'5"" and 110 pounds but the small was still a bit tight in the waist, and I almost always wear a small in pants. Returned them for a medium.

2,AFYROU2VAFAM2RSSQ5LPMRNFP6QQ,True,"Great fit, super comfy.","When I pulled size medium out of the bag, I thought it was going to be too small. The waist is tiny. When I put them on, however, they fit like a glove. It's like leggings and joggers had a baby. Fitting with just a little bit of room. I ordered 2 other pairs, including a large pair for a looser fit and longer leg. The large is just a wee bit roomier. The fabric is super stretchy and smooth. I love the tapered ankle, the pockets and the high waist. Decent quality, especially for the price. I haven't washed them yet.

3,AHYDXJLH2YD364W3NU6T6ZXDUVUQ,True,Very soft and comfortable,"These may be the softest, most comfortable pants I've ever worn. They have a high waist band that fits snug but not uncomfortable at all. I'm 6ft tall so they are definitely on the short side of a Capri pant for me but that's usual and I think it looks great anyways. I pull them up a little to give more of a jogging pant look anyways. The pockets are deep and flat against the front thigh. Now, the only thing I hate to say about them because they are so comfy is they aren't the most flattering pant I've ever worn, especially on my bum. The fabric doesn't hide cellulite well and it's a bit clingy and shiny so it just doesn't flatter that part of my body. That could be remedied by going up a size because they definitely fit snug but I would say true to their sizing chart. Again, I'm 6 ft and 180lbs and ordered Large so these will fit completely different on someone else. That being said, I still love these pants and wear them with a little longer shirt to hide the one part I don't love. They washed and dried no problem and my dog's hair doesn't cling to this fabric so I'm all about them. For the price, they are fantastic and I'm thinking I'll order another pair up a size to see if it makes a different in the fit. Also worn them to work out and honestly couldn't be happier with their versatility and comfort.","August 5, 2020",BDC,4.0,One,https://www.amazon.ca/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHYDXJLH2YD364W3NU6T6ZXDUVUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,2020-09-20 22:32:07.905074,2020-09-20 22:32:08.032928,THE GYM PEOPLE Athletic Joggers for Women Sweatpants with Pockets Workout Tapered Lounge Yoga Pants Women's Leggings,,38,B002G9UDYG
4,AHLOGOOYA3TL44SSKF7WRV6E3MJQ,True,Fits small. Definitely need to size up.,These are not sweatpants as I remember. They are made with some kind of stretchy polyester similar to lulu leggings.

5,AEPPJF6J4F6HBS2IXQOOELYSSSGA,True,Perfect for workout or very casual dressing,"These are great casual pants. However were I a tall person they would be a bit short. I am 5’ 1” and they are just about the right length. I also recommend ordering a size larger than you normally would for overall fit.
The material is a bit shinier than I anticipated but not so much so that I would not wear them. They styling is similar to the LuLu On The Fly pant but they are not exactly the same, as some others have stated. The waist is not draw string, the cuff is made from the same material as the pant, they are not double layered and are a different material.

6,AGOCWFZDN4D6FRCSWFQ24DHAD6OQ,True,They’re just ok,"They are similar to the lulu align jogger in style but that’s where the comparison ends. They’re just ok. I find the material a little scratchy, doesn’t have flat seams and has a fairly wide elastic at the top of the waist band. They’re more of a bathing suit material. I’m 5’4 and the full length are perfect for me. They will work for what I want them for which is basically lounging and working from home but I’d rather spend the money on the lulu’s. Can’t speak to longevity or how they will stand up to the washing machine.

But the cuffs are wide and stretchy and soft so I can sort of scrunch them up a bit to capri length and they look and feel great. Surprisingly flattering.

12,AHSXYJ6QHIE2WVZ6OUR6D6VKUIEQ,True,Could these be my new favorite pants?,"These looked a little too shiny when I took them out of the package at first (I don't know why I thought they would just be dark cotton black - they are clearly not cotton) and they had some creases from being folded up, but I put them in the dryer for a bit to get the creases out.

I LOVE the way these fit - I have tried lots of different kinds of joggers (not expensive ones, usually less than $40) and they are usually really baggy near the ankles or at the back (I understand they are supposed to be somewhat baggy as they are not leggings). These feel like fancy sweatpants. They can actually be dressed up quite easily because they are not cotton and won't look old and pilled up quickly. They fit snug in the right places and have awesome roomy pockets, I think I had my hands in pockets for most of the day when I wore them :)

They are fitted in the butt area, but a little loose in the legs so they feel breathable and more comfortable, could definitely live in these. I always wear high waisted leggings so the height of these is perfect for me. I wore these climbing and then to work right after (I work at a gym), but they do look very nice to wear out and about as well.
