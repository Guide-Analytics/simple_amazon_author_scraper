After settling on Hanes and having them either wear out or get chewed by our puppy, I needed to buy some more pairs.

From what I remembered of the last time I bought socks, I bought Hanes crew cut FreshIQ socks, so i bought these since they matched up. However I immediately discovered that even though they had all the same labels and appearance, they were different and didn't feel as nice. Eventually I found the correct socks at Walmart, where they stocked Hanes Sport Cuts crew socks with FreshIQ which are more comfortable than these socks.

I wish Hanes didn't offer so many different variations of the same style of sock. At least now that I've found my preferred style, I can ensure I always get the right ones.","January 31, 2020",JMJR,4.0,0,https://www.amazon.ca/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE3HPIWILZ5VUJCIUATHK54J3EBQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,2020-09-29 02:30:01.908646,2020-09-29 02:30:02.278763,Hanes Men's 6 pack FreshIQ Cushion Crew Sock,No,"45,844",B002G9UDYG,AECJHGAHVQCKW4VWKWLBVFDXJDMQ
