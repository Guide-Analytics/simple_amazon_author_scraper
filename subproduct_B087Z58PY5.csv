0,AF2KZ4WOB3O7WTB4GOCXFWVEEEJQ,True,Very good...,"Suits more than all my needs. I made all the updates yesterday and everything worked fine and today, Google offers me to fulfil the form for the warranty. This notebook flip is very amazing and it is nearly zero noise. It goes up to 2.8Ghz speed, connect to the 5G, battery last all day and it took me only 3 hours for a full charge. It also provides a lot of good apps and tools from Microsoft and Google. So, like I was only expecting a typewriter for my writing work, this one is a real gift for the price. Large screen, metal solid device (a bit heavy compare to the new ones), smooth keys to type, touchscreen works fine and funny flip to use too. To make a long story short, I love it! But in my case, unfortunately for my work, I need more memory. So I decided to returning it and buy another one.","August 5, 2020",Suzanne ,5.0,9,https://www.amazon.ca/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF2KZ4WOB3O7WTB4GOCXFWVEEEJQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,2020-09-17 18:33:06.248873,2020-09-17 18:33:06.379521,"ASUS VivoBook Flip 14 Thin and Light 2-in-1 Laptop, 14” HD Touchscreen, Intel Celeron N4020 Processor, 4GB RAM, 128GB EMMC, Windows 10 Home in S Mode, Fingerprint, J401MA-AB01-CA",Asus,"#160 in Electronics (See Top 100 in Electronics)
